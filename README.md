## Abstract

As the demand for privacy-preserving technologies grow, effective identification of personal identifiable information (PII) has become a critical challenge across various domains and regulations. Traditional
named entity recognition (NER) and existing datasets fall short in accurately identifying both direct and indirect personal identifiers required for text anonymization. In this work, we explore novel
approaches to enhance token predictions by leveraging entity information for token classification. Our experiments demonstrate a consistent improvement of 4% and 6% on recall and F1-score against baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of attention mask manipulation using known entity information.
