Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by four Turkish nationals, Mr Galip Yalman, Mr Bahattin Sar\u0131soy, Mr Osman \u00c7a\u011flayan and Mr Yusuf \u00c7amca (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 29 November 1996.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr S. Esmer, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicants alleged that their case, which commenced in 1989 and terminated in 1996, was not heard within a reasonable time as required by the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nBy a decision of 15 May 2003, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nIn September 1980 the applicants were taken into police custody and were subsequently placed in detention on remand on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. The Erzincan Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Erzincan Martial Law Court (s\u0131k\u0131y\u00f6netim askeri mahkemesi) charging the applicants under Article 146 of the Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation whose object was to undermine the constitutional order.\n\nOn various dates between 1982 and 1984 the applicants were released pending trial.\n\nOn 13 September 1988 the Erzincan Martial Law Court acquitted the applicants of the charges against them.\n\nOn various dates in March, April and June 1989 the applicants brought individual actions before the Sinop Assize Court against the Treasury, pursuant to Law no. 466. They requested compensation for their unjustified detention on remand.\n\nOn 20 October 1989 the court decided to join the applicants\u2019 cases.\n\nOn 15 December 1993 the Sinop Assize Court awarded non\u2011pecuniary compensation to the applicants. The applicants appealed, arguing that the amount of compensation awarded was not sufficient.\n\nOn 31 January 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court.\n\nOn 6 June 1995 the Sinop Assize Court increased the amount of non\u2011pecuniary compensation.\n\nOn 15 June 1995 the applicants again appealed.\n\nOn 30 May 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the judgment of the assize court."}

Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Turkish nationals, Mr Mehmet B\u00fclent Y\u0131lmaz and Mr \u015eahin Y\u0131lmaz (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 20 May 1998.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr H.\u00c7. Akbulut, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 21 March 2002 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1975 and 1970 respectively.\n\nOn 19 and 20 August 1995 respectively the applicants were taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Ayd\u0131n Security Directorate on suspicion of their membership to an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP/C.\n\nIn their police statements the applicants accepted the accusations against them.\n\nOn 22 August 1995 the applicants were brought before the investigating judge at the Ayd\u0131n Magistrate\u2019s Court, where they repeated the statements they had made to the police. The investigating judge ordered that they be placed in detention on remand.\n\nIn an indictment dated 6 September 1995, the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants. He charged the first applicant with being member of an armed gang under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and the second applicant with aiding and abetting an armed gang under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.\n\nDuring the hearings before the Izmir State Security Court, the applicants denied the statements they had made to the police and the investigating judge.\n\nOn 25 March 1997 the Izmir State Security Court, composed of two civilian judges and a military judge, convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced the first applicant to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment and the second applicant to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. Neither the applicants nor their lawyers were present in this last hearing.\n\nThe applicants appealed. On 12 November 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal, upholding the Izmir State Security Court\u2019s reasoning and assessment of evidence. The decision, which was pronounced in the absence of the applicants and their lawyers, was deposited with the Registry of the Izmir State Security Court on 21 November 1997."}

case originated in an application (no. 19582/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ali \u00c7imen (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 8 December 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. \u0130\u015feri, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 March 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicant during his police custody and the non-communication of the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Izmir.\n\nOn 17 April 2000 the applicant was taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of his involvement in the activities of an illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was interrogated at the Anti-Terrorist branch in the absence of a lawyer. According to a form explaining arrested persons\u2019 rights which the applicant had signed, he had been reminded of the charges against him and of his right to remain silent. In his statement, the applicant admitted to his involvement in the illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn 20 April 2000 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge at the Izmir State Security Court. Before the public prosecutor and the judge, again in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant admitted that he had participated in certain activities of the illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested to visit him; however this request was rejected by the Public Prosecutor.\n\nOn 2 May 2000 the Public Prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with that court, accusing the applicant of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. He requested that the applicant be sentenced and convicted under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).\n\nOn 5 December 2000 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment. In its decision, the court attached particular importance to the applicant\u2019s statements to the investigating judge.\n\nOn 25 December 2000 the applicant appealed. On an unspecified date, the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion. This opinion was not served on the applicant or his representative. On 11 June 2001, the Court of Cassation, upholding the reasoning and assessment of the Izmir State Security Court, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal."}

case originated in an application (no. 21377/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ahmet Kenan Er (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 April 2004. The applicant was represented by Mr H.\u0130. Er, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 18 November 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 10 October 1990 the applicant, who served as a first lieutenant in the Turkish Armed Forces at the material time, was arrested on suspicion of, inter alia, professional misconduct and bribery.\n\nOn 28 March 1991 the military prosecutor at the 33rd Infantry Division Commander's office filed an indictment charging the applicant with twenty-four different offences, including professional misconduct, bribery and assault and battery of his inferiors.\n\nOn 12 May 1993 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty of the remaining offences.\n\nOn 19 January 1994 the Military Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in relation to certain offences and quashed the remainder of the judgment on grounds of, inter alia, insufficient investigation.\n\nOn 7 November 1995 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty as charged for the remaining offences.\n\nOn 6 March 1996 the Military Court of Cassation partially upheld the first-instance court's judgment.\n\nOn 16 April 1996 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court once again acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty of the remaining offences.\n\nOn 9 May 1997 the applicant was expelled from the armed forces.\n\nOn 10 June 1998 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on procedural grounds in relation to certain charges and for being time-barred (zamana\u015f\u0131m\u0131) in relation to the remainder.\n\nOn 5 August 1999 the \u00c7orlu Military Court found the applicant guilty as charged in relation to those offences which were not time-barred and of which he had not already been acquitted.\n\nOn 28 March 2001 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court once again in the light of a recent amendment to the relevant jurisdictional rules, and held that the case should be heard by ordinary criminal courts.\n\nOn 26 December 2001 the \u00c7orlu Military Court issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction and referred the case to the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court.\n\nOn 2 December 2003 the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against the applicant as the prosecution had become time-barred."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 45288/99) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Jan Ci\u0105gadlak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 May 1998.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nOn 4 December 2001 the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nOn 2 April 1992 the applicant filed with the Warsaw Regional Court (s\u0105d wojew\u00f3dzki) a petition in which he requested the annulment of a judgment delivered in 1947 in criminal proceedings against him, submitting that they had been of a political nature. He also claimed compensation.\n\nOn 10 February 1993 the court annulled that judgment. However, its decision did not relate to the compensation claim.\n\nOn 19 February 1993 the applicant filed another compensation claim.\n\nSubsequently, he lodged several complaints concerning the inactivity of the court, but to no avail.\n\nIn her letters of 15 December 1993 and 29 June 1994, in reply to the applicant's complaints, a judge of the Regional Court informed the applicant that the delay in the examination of his compensation claim was caused by a large number of similar requests lodged with that court and the dearth of judges.\n\nOn 22 February 1995 the court held a hearing. A public prosecutor requested that the proceedings be stayed, submitting that a part of the Regional Court's decision of 10 February 1993 was invalid and required supplementation. Subsequently, the court stayed the proceedings.\n\nThe hearing scheduled for 22 March 1995 was adjourned at the applicant's request.\n\nOn 4 April 1995 the Regional Court asked the Office for the State Protection (Urz\u0105d Ochrony Pa\u0144stwa) to submit certain documents. The documents were submitted to the court on 27 March 1996.\n\nOn 4 July 1996 the proceedings were resumed.\n\nThe court adjourned the hearing scheduled for 23 January 1997, as the proceedings concerning the annulment of the criminal judgment against the applicant given in 1947 had not been completed.\n\nOn 19 June 2000 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment. It awarded the applicant PLN 7,500 in compensation. He did not lodge an appeal against that judgment."}

Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Ms Gra\u017cyna Walto\u015b and Ms Wanda Pawlicz (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 30 June 2006.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr M. Werner, a lawyer practising in Szczecin-Mierzyn. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 21 June 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1949 and 1956, respectively, and live in Koszalin.\n\nA. Civil proceedings for payment\n\nOn 1 August 1997 the applicants filed a claim with the Koszalin District Court against a housing co-operative concerning the amount of maintenance fees to be fixed in respect of their apartment building.\n\nOn 24 November 1998 the proceedings were stayed pending the termination of parallel proceedings relating to the alleged nullity of an amendment made to the co-operative\u2019s statute. The Koszalin District Court resumed the proceedings on 7 March 2003.\n\nOn 13 May 2003 a hearing was held. The court requested the Koszalin Regional Court to provide the case-file of the proceedings relating to the alleged nullity of an amendment made to the co-operative\u2019s statute.\n\nOn 16 June 2003 the Koszalin District Court decided to stay the proceedings at the applicants\u2019 request. They were resumed, upon the applicants\u2019 request, on 17 November 2004.\n\nHearings were subsequently held on 23 February, 11 August, 22 September, 10 November and 9 December 2005.\n\nOn 30 January 2006 the Koszalin District Court decided to admit an expert opinion. On 6 June and 16 August 2006 the expert requested prolongation of the time-limit for submission of the opinion.\n\nOn 6 September 2006 the court summoned the expert to submit the opinion within 7 days.\n\nIn 2007 the District Court held 7 hearings.\n\n18 October 2007 the Koszalin District Court gave a judgment in the case.\n\nThe judgment was quashed on 27 February 2009 by the Koszalin Regional Court and the case remitted for re-examination.\n\nThe proceedings are currently pending before the first-instance court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 30 November 2005 the applicants lodged a complaint under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d). On 6 January 2006 the Koszalin Regional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaint, finding that the trial court could not be held responsible for any delays and that the proceedings had been prolonged as it had been necessary to stay them."}

lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u0142owiecki (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 3 August 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms I. Korna\u015b-Pierzak, a lawyer practising in Cracow. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, inter alia, that the lustration proceedings in his case had been unfair, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 25 February 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Stronie \u015al\u0105skie.\n\nOn 3 August 1997 the Law of 11 April 1997 on disclosing work for or service in the State\u2019s security services or collaboration with them between 1944 and 1990 by persons exercising public functions (ustawa o ujawnieniu pracy lub s\u0142u\u017cby w organach bezpiecze\u0144stwa pa\u0144stwa lub wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy z nimi w latach 1944-1990 os\u00f3b pe\u0142ni\u0105cych funkcje publiczne) (the \u201c1997 Lustration Act\u201d) entered into force.\n\nOn 14 April 2004 the applicant, a candidate for the European Parliament, declared that he had not collaborated with the communist-era secret services. He was subsequently elected as a Member of the European Parliament.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) decided to institute lustration proceedings against the applicant following a request made by the Commissioner of the Public Interest (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego) on the grounds that the applicant had lied in his lustration declaration by denying that he had cooperated with the secret services.\n\nOn 17 February 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the first\u2011instance lustration court, found that the applicant had submitted an untrue lustration declaration since he had been an intentional and secret collaborator with the State\u2019s secret services. The court established that the applicant had met on probably two occasions in 1973 with agents of the secret services and had agreed to help them as a consultant.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision. He submitted that he had never collaborated with the secret services and the meeting in question had been in connection with the preparation of an article. The applicant also referred to his subsequent activity in the \u201cSolidarno\u015b\u0107\u201d movement for which he had been persecuted and detained by the communist authorities. Subsequently, he was allowed to leave Poland and between 1985 and 1994 he was a deputy of the Polish Section of Radio Free Europe in Munich.\n\nOn 6 June 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the second\u2011instance lustration court, upheld the impugned judgment.\n\nOn 1 February 2007 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal. That decision was notified to the applicant on 8 March 2007."}

Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr January Jagie\u0142\u0142o (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 August 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government.\n\nApplying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nOn 28 November 1995, the applicant, who is a taxi driver by profession, was involved in a traffic accident.\n\nOn 28 February 1996 the applicant was charged with causing the accident. On 2 September 1997 the applicant was served with a bill of indictment.\n\nThe hearing set for 16 March 1998 was adjourned due to the presiding judge\u2019s illness. On 11 July 2001 the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) held the first hearing in the case. The hearing set for 20 September 2001 was adjourned due to the witnesses\u2019 absence.\n\nOn 7 December 2001 the court ordered an expert opinion to be obtained. On 30 April 2002 the expert submitted his opinion to the court. The court ordered a supplementary opinion to be obtained.\n\nThe hearing set for 18 September 2002 was adjourned. At the hearing held on 7 November 2002 the Warsaw District Court gave judgment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 6 June 2003 the Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) quashed the first\u2011instance judgment and remitted the case.\n\nFollowing the remittal, on 23 September 2004 the Warsaw District Court gave judgment. The court sentenced the applicant to one year imprisonment stayed for two years. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe applicant filed a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (\u201c2004 Act\u201d). On 16 November 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court gave a decision and confirmed that the proceedings had indeed been lengthy. However, the court did not grant any compensation to the applicant.\n\nOn 29 April 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court held an appeal hearing and gave judgment. The judgment is final.\n\nOn 6 June 2005 the applicant again filed a complaint with the Supreme Court under the 2004 Act alleging that a copy of the final judgment had not yet been served on him. The Supreme Court rejected the complaint, on a later unknown date, as the applicant had never asked to be served with a copy of the final judgment.\n\nOn 21 February 2006 the applicant for the third time filed a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under the 2004 Act. On 29 September 2006 the court refused to deal with the merits of the complaint. The court held that the proceedings had already been terminated and therefore the complaint was groundless."}

originated in an application (no. 63131/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Leszek G\u0119bura (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 12 May 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that a delay in releasing him from prison had given rise to a violation of Article 5.\n\nOn 17 March 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Starachowice.\n\nThe applicant was serving a prison sentence in Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison following three separate convictions. The overall term of his imprisonment was due to come to an end on 6 January 2002.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code applicable to re-offenders, the applicant became eligible for conditional release after having served three-quarters of the overall term of his imprisonment, namely on 6 January 1999. After that date, the applicant requested a court on several occasions to grant him conditional release. However, his requests were denied on grounds of insufficient progress in his rehabilitation. On 20 March 2000 the prison governor requested the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) to order the applicant's release (warunkowe przedterminowe zwolnienie) in view of his satisfactory rehabilitation. The Tarn\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor objected to that request.\n\nOn 22 March 2000 the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court gave a decision ordering the applicant's conditional release for a three-year probationary period. It placed the applicant under the court officer's supervision and imposed certain other obligations on him.\n\nThe Tarn\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor appealed against that decision. The Regional Court did not amend its decision and transmitted the prosecutor's appeal to the Cracow Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny).\n\nThe hearing before the Court of Appeal was scheduled for 12 April 2000 at 8.45 a.m. On that day the Cracow Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Regional Court. No further appeal lay against the decision of the Court of Appeal. In the applicant's submission, the Court of Appeal's decision was delivered at 9 a.m.\n\nLater on 12 April 2000, a certified copy of the Court of Appeal's decision was sent to the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court, which received it on 13 April 2000. On the same day the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court ordered the governor of the Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison to release the applicant and served him with a copy of the Court of Appeal's decision. The governor received these documents on 14 April 2000.\n\nAccording to the official release certificate, the applicant was released on 14 April 2000.

(no. 47328/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Nurettin \u015eirin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 15 March 1999.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Arani, a lawyer practising in Middlesex (United Kingdom). The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 27 April 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal and the failure to notify the applicant of the public prosecutor\u2019s submissions on his appeal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1964, resides in Istanbul.\n\nOn 31 January 1997 the applicant made a speech about the liberation movement in Palestine and praised the Muslim leaders who worked for the liberation of Jerusalem during a meeting which was organised by the Sincan District Council in Ankara.\n\nOn 6 February 1997 the applicant was taken into police custody. In his statement, he explained that he supported the Iranian regime and that he longed for a regime that was based on the Koran.\n\nOn 13 February 1997 the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court. During his questioning by the prosecutor, the applicant repeated his police statement. On the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge attached to the Ankara State Security Court and he was subsequently placed in detention on remand.\n\nIn an indictment dated 7 March 1997, the Ankara State Security Court public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant.\n\nBefore the Ankara State Security Court, which was composed of three judges including a military judge, the applicant contested the charges against him.\n\nOn 15 October 1997 the Ankara State Security Court convicted the applicant of being a member of an illegal organisation and sentenced him to seventeen years and six months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to Article 168 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 6 January 1998 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. The Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion on the merits of the appeal. The opinion was not notified to the applicant, but was read out during the hearing before the Court of Cassation.\n\nOn 21 September 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, upholding the Ankara State Security Court\u2019s assessment of evidence and its reasons for rejecting the applicant\u2019s defence.\n\nOn 24 December 1998 the Chief Public Prosecutor attached to the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant\u2019s request for rectification."}

10262/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Turgut K\u00f6kl\u00fc (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 17 February 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs S. Akat, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 September 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 10 March 1998 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, namely the TIKB (the Revolutionary Communist Union of Turkey).\n\nOn 13 March 1998 he was brought before the public prosecutor and then the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court. The latter remanded him in custody on the same day.\n\nOn 17 March 1998 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Istanbul State Security Court, charging the applicant with membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code.\n\nBetween 25 March 1998 and 21 March 2001, the court held nineteen hearings. During these hearings the Istanbul Security Court, relying on the state of the evidence, the nature of the offence, and the duration of his detention, refused to release the applicant.\n\nOn 21 March 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court pronounced its judgment and convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment under Article 168 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 8 August 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed this judgment. The case was accordingly remitted to the Istanbul State Security Court.\n\nOn 17 September 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court resumed the trial. During the subsequent hearings, the court rejected the applicant\u2019s requests for release, having regard to the state of the evidence.\n\nAt the hearing on 1 June 2003, the applicant\u2019s lawyer once again requested the court to release the applicant. In her submissions, she also drew attention to the psychological state and treatment of the applicant. The court rejected this request. An appeal lodged in that connection was also dismissed by a further court on 28 August 2003.\n\nBy Law no. 5190, in June 2004 State Security Courts were abolished. Subsequently, the Istanbul Assize Court acquired jurisdiction over the case.\n\nOn 25 October 2004 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested the court to release the applicant. On 1 November 2004 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nAccording to the information made available to the Court by the parties to date, the case is apparently still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court."}

under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by twelve Turkish nationals, Mr Resul Sadak, Mr Nihat Osal, Mr Mehmet \u00c7akar, Mr Rustem Bayar, Mr Tahir Kutlu, Mr Cengiz Bal\u0131k, Mr \u0130zzet Belge, Mr Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mr Mehmet Temelkuran, Mr Mehmet Nezir Ayan, Mr Yakup Uyar and Mr Erdal G\u00fcler (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 1 April 2001.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr T. El\u00e7i, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 3 November 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the applicants\u2019 right to be brought promptly before a judge. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nAt the time of the events giving rise to the application, Mr Resul Sadak was the provincial leader and the other applicants were members of the Peoples\u2019 Democracy Party (Halk\u0131n Demokrasi Partisi, hereinafter \u201cHADEP\u201d) in \u015e\u0131rnak, which was a province in the State of Emergency region.\n\nOn 23 September 2000 Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Yakup Uyar went to Batman in order to participate in the Batman Provincial Congress of HADEP in two cars belonging to Yakup Uyar and Erdal G\u00fcler. On their way back to \u015e\u0131rnak from Batman, they were stopped in D\u00fczova village, in Cizre, and arrested by gendarmerie officers. The applicants were then taken to the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial gendarmerie command.\n\nOn 27 September 2000 at 2 p.m. Erdal G\u00fcler was taken into custody. He was kept in custody until 11 a.m. on 1 October 2000.\n\nOn 1 October 2000 the applicants were brought before the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor and the \u015e\u0131rnak Magistrates\u2019 Court (sulh ceza mahkemesi). On the same day, the \u015e\u0131rnak Magistrates\u2019 Court ordered that Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Erdal G\u00fcler be detained on remand and that Yakup Uyar be released.\n\nSubsequently, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicants on charges of aiding and abetting the PKK contrary to Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713, and illegal possession of firearms and explosives contrary to Article 264 \u00a7 5 of the Criminal Code and Article 13 \u00a7 2 of Law no. 6136.\n\nOn 12 December 2000 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court ordered the applicants\u2019 release pending trial.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003 the applicants were acquitted of the charges against them."}

originated in an application (no. 38414/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Umut Taner (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 2 October 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K. Bilgi\u00e7, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he did not receive a fair and public hearing, as he was not informed promptly of the accusation against him, he did not have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and that he was not allowed to defend himself in person or through a lawyer.\n\nOn 13 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nOn 30 May 2006 the Government filed observations on the admissibility and merits. On 19 October 2006 the President of the Third Section refused to include in the case file the applicant's observations in reply to Government's observations and his just satisfaction claims which were filed outside the time-limit (Rule 38 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1984 and lives in \u0130zmir.\n\nOn 26 June 2002 the applicant, together with a friend of his, quarrelled with a man in a park. The quarrel had turned into a fight and the applicant stabbed the man in his left leg. The police and the public prosecutor took the statements of the parties, including the applicant. The applicant denied having injured the man. Following their questioning, they were all released.\n\nOn 3 July 2002 the Public Prosecutor at the \u0130zmir Magistrates' Court filed an indictment against the applicant, on account of assault with a knife and occasioning actual bodily harm. The indictment was not notified to the applicant.\n\nAfter having examined the case file, on 17 July 2002 the \u0130zmir Magistrates' Court issued a penal order, convicting the applicant and sentencing him to pay 290,805,465 Turkish liras (TRL).\n\nOn 30 August 2002 the penal order was notified to the applicant.\n\nOn 6 September 2002 the applicant challenged the decision of the \u0130zmir Magistrate's Court, before the \u0130zmir Criminal Court of First Instance. He argued that he had been deprived of his right of defence in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 11 September 2002 the \u0130zmir Criminal Court of First Instance upheld the decision of the Magistrate's Court, maintaining that it was in accordance with the law and procedure.\n\nOn 25 September 2002 the \u0130zmir Public Prosecutor issued a payment order under which the applicant was obliged to pay the relevant amount. He was warned that in case he failed to pay the due amount, the fine would be converted into prison sentence.\n\nThe applicant paid the relevant charge on 26 November 2002."}

Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Zbigniew Radaj, (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 February 1994 and 4 October 1996 respectively.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Krzysztof Drzewicki of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his correspondence with the Convention organs was, while he was detained on remand, twice intercepted, opened and read by the prison authorities and by the court before which the criminal proceedings against him were pending.\n\nThe applications were transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe applications were allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1. On 14 October 1999 the Court decided to join the applications.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.\n\nBy a decision of 21 March 2002 the Court declared the applications partly admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a Polish national, who was born in 1953 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nTwo letters from the Secretariat of the European Commission of Human Rights, posted on 20 March 1996 and on 14 May 1996, were intercepted, opened and read by the administration of the Warszawa-S\u0142u\u017cewiec prison, where the applicant was detained on remand. They were subsequently forwarded to the Warsaw District Court, before which criminal proceedings against the applicant were pending at that time, and were read by the court.\n\nOn 29 April 1996 the applicant requested the President of the Warsaw District Court to explain what was the legal basis on which his correspondence with the European Commission of Human Rights had been opened and read.\n\nHe reiterated his complaint on 31 July 1996 in a letter to the President of the Regional Court. In reply, on 15 October 1996 the President of the Regional Court informed him that Article 8 of the Convention did not prohibit censorship of correspondence of persons detained on remand. It was also permitted under Section 33 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Detention on Remand. The correspondence sent to the European Commission of Human Rights fell within the scope of this provision. It was further stated that the text of the Convention did not contain provisions relating to the inviolability of the correspondence to and from the European Commission of Human Rights."}

Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Piotr Osuch (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 July 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 18 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the excessive length of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nOn 10 March 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery and extortion. He was also suspected of being a member of an organised criminal group.\n\nOn 12 March 1999 the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be detained until 9 June 1999. The court found that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question.\n\nOn 1 June 1999 the District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention. It referred to the interests of the pending investigation, such as the need to obtain additional evidence. The court also considered that the applicant, if released, could induce witnesses to give false testimony.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged several times by the District Court for the same reasons as before.\n\nOn 27 August 1999 the Warsaw Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okr\u0119gowy) lodged with the Warsaw District Court a bill of indictment against the applicant and six other persons. They were indicted of several counts of robbery, extortion, and membership of an organised criminal group.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently extended by the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) on 6 March, 26 June, 28 September and 30 November 2001. The court considered that keeping the applicant in custody was justified by the existence of strong evidence against him and the gravity of the charges. It was also necessary as he could obstruct the proper course of the proceedings or induce witnesses to give false testimony. The applicant\u2019s appeals against those decisions were dismissed.\n\nOn 16 January 2002 the Warsaw District Court convicted the applicant of several counts of robbery and extortion committed in an organised criminal group. The applicant was sentenced to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) upheld the first-instance judgment on 6 February 2003.\n\nOn 28 October 2003 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal."}

34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Etem Karag\u00f6z (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 18 August 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. G\u00fczel, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 27 June 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29\u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nOn 19 January 1994 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody by officers of the Diyarbak\u0131r security police in connection with an investigation into an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 7 February 1994 the applicant was brought before the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor and then the investigating judge, who remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nBy an indictment dated 17 March 1994, the public prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and a number of others, accusing him, inter alia, of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory under Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 30 July 1997 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court convicted and sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment, pursuant to Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 1 March 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on procedural grounds and remitted the case to the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court. Following constitutional amendments introduced on 7 May 2004, the State Security Courts were totally abolished. Subsequently, the applicant\u2019s case was resumed before the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nThroughout the whole proceedings the applicant regularly requested his release whereas the trial courts rejected his requests. On 20 October 2005 the applicant noted that he had already been detained for a period of more than eleven years and reiterated his request. Relying on the accusations against the applicant, the existence of strong evidence against him and the content of the case file, the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r refused his request again. The applicant appealed. On 25 October 2005 the 4th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r dismissed the appeal without further reasoning.\n\nOn 9 March 2007 the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r convicted the applicant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On 7 March 2008 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment."}

the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Seydo Kalg\u0131 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 September 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. G\u00fczeler, a lawyer practising in \u015eanl\u0131urfa. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 7 July 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1938 and lives in \u015eanl\u0131urfa.\n\nIn the cadastral survey carried out in 1964 some plots of land in Siverek village were registered in the names of the applicant and a number of other individuals. In 1971 an individual further donated his share of a plot in the same village to the applicant.\n\nOn 28 August 1972 two villagers (O.T., H.Y.) instituted civil proceedings against another villager (M.E.) objecting to the cadastral registrations and claiming that they were the lawful owners of the land in question on the basis of a registration dating from before 1950. It appears that on unspecified dates during the course of the proceedings numerous villagers, including the applicant, became parties to the proceedings, which continued with three complainants, seventeen defendants and two intervening third parties. Both the claimants and defendants claimed to have title to the land in question.\n\nOn 9 June 1983 the trial court requested the applicant's address to be determined so that he could be summoned before the court. On 20 March 1985 the trial court decided to publish the summons in a country-wide newspaper in an attempt to determine the applicant's whereabouts.\n\nOn 18 November 1985 H.Y. submitted a letter to the trial court informing the judge of an agreement he had reached with the applicant and stating that the applicant would appear before the court to testify accordingly.\n\nThe case file indicates that the applicant did not appear before the trial court until 22 March 2004, when he presented himself as one of the parties. On 22 November 2004 the applicant's representative submitted a power of attorney to the trial court.\n\nDuring the course of the proceedings the court held an on-site inspection on 23 June 1986. A number of expert reports were requested concerning the title registrations. Numerous witnesses were heard on various occasions. Some of the defendants transferred part of their shares to others on different dates.\n\nOn 5 March 2007 the Siverek Cadastral Court delivered its judgment in favour of the applicant and the other defendants. It appears that the number of claimants and defendants had reached twenty-eight and eighty-one respectively by the time the judgment was delivered.\n\nThe case is still pending before the Court of Cassation."}

originated in an application (no. 39712/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Janusz Dudek (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 October 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 14 January 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Cz\u0119stochowa.\n\nOn 23 October 2003 the applicant, who is a police officer, was charged with abuse of powers.\n\nOn 4 November 2003 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 5 November 2003 the applicant was released. The Krak\u00f3w Appeal Prosecutor (Prokuratura Apelacyjna) suspended the applicant from professional duties and ordered that he be subjected to police supervision in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It further referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nOn 20 November 2003 the applicant lodged an application with the prosecutor, requesting access to the investigation file. On 28 November 2003 the prosecutor dismissed the application. He referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nIn the meantime, on 22 November 2003, the applicant had lodged an application for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. The application was dismissed by the Prosecutor of Appeal. In his decision the prosecutor referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation and the seriousness of the offences the applicant was charged with.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, on 4 March and 2 June 2004, 14 March 2005 and 28 April 2006, the applicant made unsuccessful applications for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure and he appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against decisions dismissing his applications. In his applications he referred to the poor financial situation of his family resulting from the lengthy application of the preventive measure.\n\nOn 4 April 2006 the Krak\u00f3w Appeal Prosecutor decided to obtain a psychiatric report on the applicant and his ability to stand trial.\n\nOn 3 September 2007 the applicant lodged an application for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. On 2 October 2007 the Krak\u00f3w Prosecutor of Appeal lifted the preventive measure.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the proceedings were severed on several occasions and of the 110 suspects in this case 75 were indicted. However, the investigation concerning the remaining suspects, including the applicant, has not yet been completed."}

applicant\u201d), on 1 October 2004.\n\nBy a letter of 11 March 2007, the Registry was informed of the death of the applicant. His parents, Mrs Muhteber \u00dctebay and Mr \u0130yasettin \u00dctebay, and his brother, Mr Ercan \u00dctebay, declared their intention to pursue the application.\n\nFor practical reasons, Mr \u00dctebay will continue to be called \u201cthe applicant\u201d in this judgment, although his family is now to be regarded as such (see Ahmet Sad\u0131k v. Greece, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011V, p. 1641, \u00a7 3).\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr F. Babao\u011flu, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 November 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lived in \u0130stanbul. He died on 14 June 2005.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nOn 7 March 1994 the applicant was taken into police custody in Mu\u015f on suspicion of being a member of the illegal PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). On 13 March 1994 he was handed over to the Istanbul Security Directorate for further investigation.\n\nOn 21 March 1994 the applicant was taken before the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who ordered his detention pending trial.\n\nBy an indictment dated 23 June 1994, the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and forty-five other defendants before the Istanbul State Security Court, accusing them, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of involvement in activities that undermined the constitutional order of the State. The prosecution requested that the applicant be sentenced pursuant to Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 5 May 1999 the Istanbul State Security Court, composed of three judges including a military judge, decided that the applicant's case should be separated from the file as his final defence submissions had not been submitted to the court.\n\nOn 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judge sitting on the bench of the Istanbul State Security Court was replaced by a civilian judge.\n\nThe case against the applicant continued before the Istanbul State Security Court. In the course of the proceedings the State Security Court rejected the applicant's requests for release, taking into account the nature of the alleged offence and the state of the evidence.\n\nOn 5 April 2004 the applicant was released pending trial. The case was still pending before the domestic courts when the applicant died on 14 June 2005."}

case originated in an application (no. 62324/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Wojciech Depa (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 26 May 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 December 2005 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.\n\nOn 14 January 1998 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 16 January 1998 the Krak\u00f3w District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed offences of kidnapping, sequestration, attempted murder and theft. The court established that there was a risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence as he had attempted to intimidate the victim and that he might abscond since two other alleged perpetrators had gone into hiding.\n\nBetween 27 March and 11 August 1998 the applicant served a prison sentence ordered in another set of criminal proceedings.\n\nOn 6 April 1998 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and on the need to continue the investigation, in particular so that he could undergo a psychiatric examination.\n\nOn 14 July and 27 October 1998 the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was further prolonged. The latter decision was taken at a public hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The court found that keeping the applicant in custody was justified by the strong suspicion that he had committed the offences, the probability that a severe sentence would be imposed and the fact that the third alleged perpetrator was still in hiding.\n\nThe applicant appealed against those decisions arguing that there was no evidence that once released he would obstruct the proper course of the proceedings or abscond. The applicant further asked the court to take into consideration his difficult family situation as his parents needed his support.\n\nIn the meantime, on 13 July 1998, the applicant was indicted before the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy).\n\nAt a hearing held on 16 February 1999, at which the applicant was present, the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention. The court found: \u201cThe fact that [the applicant] has been charged with having committed attempted murder is a sufficient ground for imposing the most severe preventive measure, that is detention on remand.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, on 14 May and 16 August 1999, the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was prolonged by the trial court. The first decision was taken at a public hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The court relied on the strong probability that the applicant had committed the offences and the advanced stage of the trial.\n\nOn several occasions the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests to attend the court\u2019s session at which his appeals against the decisions to prolong his pre-trial detention were examined. The court established that the presence of the applicant was not necessary as he was represented by two lawyers of his choice who could attend the court\u2019s session.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s numerous applications for release and appeals against the decisions to prolong the detention were to no avail.\n\nIn 1999 the trial court held in total thirteen hearings.\n\nOn 10 January 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court gave a judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal. On 13 April 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case. The court further decided to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention on remand. His lawyers were present at the hearing.\n\nOn 27 July 2000 the trial court held the first hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The Regional Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention justifying it with reference to the reasonable suspicion that he had committed offences in question and the severity of the anticipated penalty. The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that his detention was contrary to international treaties, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nOn 24 August 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s request to attend the session at which his appeal against the decision of 27 July 2000 was to be examined, on the grounds that his presence was neither obligatory nor necessary. On the same date the court dismissed the appeal. It also dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests to release him from detention and to apply another preventive measure instead, such as bail. The Court found that his family\u2019s situation was not as difficult as the applicant had indicated. It further established that the severity of the anticipated penalty was a sufficient ground (\u201csamodzielna przes\u0142anka\u201d) for his continued detention and was consistent with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Nevertheless, the court decided to limit the period for which the detention was to be prolonged to 31 January 2001. The applicant\u2019s lawyer was present at the session.\n\nAfterwards, the applicant\u2019s detention was further prolonged at public hearings held on 22 November 2000 and 20 April, 13 June, 27 September and 13 December 2001. The applicant and his lawyers were present at these hearings. In the meantime, the court held a session on 23 February 2001 at which it prolonged the detention. One of the applicant\u2019s lawyer was present. It appears that on each occasion the Regional Court repeated the grounds for detention given previously: the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and the severity of the penalty that might be imposed. The court further dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests for release and found that the situation of his parents and his state of health were undoubtedly difficult but not \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. The decisions were upheld on appeal by the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s numerous requests for release were to no avail. His applications and appeals against the decisions to prolong his detention were dismissed at court sessions. The applicant\u2019s lawyers were present at most of those sessions.\n\nOn 6 February 2002 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment.\n\nOn 19 September 2002 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal partly allowed the appeal. The applicant was acquitted of the charge of attempted murder and his sentence was reduced to five years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant\u2019s court-appointed lawyer lodged on his behalf a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy). On 3 June 2003 the Supreme Court partly allowed the cassation appeal, quashed the appeal court\u2019s judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 24 June 2004 the Krakow Court of Appeal gave a judgment. The court amended its judgment of 19 September 2002 but it upheld the applicant\u2019s sentence. The judgment became final."}

originated in an application (no. 11375/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a German national, Mr Anton Kaleta (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 1 June 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The German Government did not make use of their right to intervene (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his daughter, which had violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention\n\nOn 12 July 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Taufkirchen, Germany.\n\nThe applicant and W.K. had a daughter M., born on 11 June 1989. The couple married in August 1989. The applicant and his wife separated on 1 August 1992.\n\nOn 3 September 1992 W.K lodged a divorce petition with the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki). On 9 February 1993 the proceedings were discontinued as she had withdrawn her petition.\n\nIn 1993 W.K. again lodged a petition for divorce, this time with the Family Court in Munich.\n\nBetween 23 February 1994 and 3 August 1994 W.K. was detained on charges of child abduction and theft. On 3 August 1994 she was acquitted by the Munich Court.\n\nOn 27 February 1995 the Munich District Court awarded custody rights to W.K. The court considered that the mother took great care of the child and that the child had very good living conditions at her mother\u2019s place.\n\nOn 15 June 1994 the applicant lodged an application with the B\u0119dzin District Court for sole custody of his daughter.\n\nOn 22 June 1995 the District Court in B\u0119dzin, Poland, gave a decision. The court awarded parental rights to W.K and limited the applicant\u2019s rights to visiting rights. The court did not specify the access arrangements. The court also restricted W.K.\u2019s parental rights by appointing a guardian to supervise her in the exercise of her rights.\n\nMeanwhile, on 9 December 1994 the applicant asked the court to specify the access arrangements.\n\nOn 5 October 1995 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Convention. It allowed the applicant to visit the child on the first Friday of each month between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. The meeting was to take place on the premises of the B\u0119dzin Family Centre (O\u015brodek pomocy dziecku i rodzinie w B\u0119dzinie). In addition, W.K and a court guardian were to be present during the meeting.\n\nOn 14 November 1996 the Bedzin Family Centre confirmed that between October 1995 and 14 November 1996 the applicant failed to report for visits. On the other hand, the child and the mother were present at every meeting.\n\nOn 20 November 1996 the applicant applied to the B\u0119dzin District Court to change the access arrangements. He wished to see his daughter during ten days of the winter holidays and two weeks in summer. On 27 November 1997 the B\u0119dzin District Court dismissed his request.\n\nOn 25 November 1996 the applicant lodged an application with the Munich District Court challenging his paternity with respect to M.K. However, a DNA test confirmed his paternity.\n\nOn 15 August 1997 the Family Court in Munich dissolved the applicant\u2019s marriage and awarded parental rights to W.K.\n\nOn 5 January 1998 W.K. instituted proceedings before the B\u0119dzin District Court in which she requested that the applicant be divested of his parental rights on the ground that he had been aggressive towards her. She further requested that the court prohibit the applicant from having contact with his daughter.\n\nOn 20 October 1998 the applicant asked the court to dismiss W.K.\u2019s request. He also requested that it grant him parental authority and limit W.K.\u2019s parental authority to a right to have contact with the child. He submitted that W.K. was incapable of bringing up a child and had a history of criminal convictions for theft. In addition, criminal proceedings against her were pending (for assault on the applicant).\n\nOn 9 March 2000 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision and dismissed both the applicant\u2019s and his ex-wife\u2019s requests. It also varied the contact arrangement of 1995. The court allowed the applicant to visit his daughter three times a year, on the first Friday of every fourth month between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. The court held that the meeting was to take place on the premises of the B\u0119dzin Family Centre and W.K. and a court guardian were to be present during the meetings.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 7 June 2000 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed his appeal. The court repeated the reasons given by the District Court.\n\nOn 20 June 2000 the Katowice District Court convicted W.K. of assault on the applicant.\n\nA further cassation appeal by the applicant was dismissed by the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) on 12 December 2000. The court referred to the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001 W.K. failed to report with the child to the B\u0119dzin Family Centre for visits. In particular, on 7 January, 5 May, and 1 September 2000, and 5 January and 4 May 2001 the applicant was present at the B\u0119dzin Family Centre. On all these occasions the mother did not bring the child.\n\nThe applicant met his daughter on 7 September 2001, 4 January, 4 May and 10 May 2002.\n\nOn October 2001 the applicant made a request for modification of his contact arrangements. He asked to see his daughter without the presence of the mother and the guardian. On 22 May 2002 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision. On the basis of an expert\u2019s report the court considered that contact with the applicant had been very stressful for the child. For these reasons and in view of the well-being of the child the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request.\n\nOn 11 October 2001 the applicant made a request to the Family Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court under Article 1050 of the Code, asking the court to fine W.K. for failure to comply with the order of 9 March 2000. On 5 June 2002 the court dismissed his request.\n\nOn 20 October 2003 the applicant met his daughter in the B\u0119dzin Family Centre.\n\nIn August 2004 the applicant\u2019s daughter (then fifteen years old) sent a letter to her father stating that she did not wish to see him.\n\nOn 3 September 2004 the mother again failed to bring M. for a visit.\n\nOn 15 December 2004 the applicant made a request to the Family Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court under Article 1050 of the Code, asking the court to fine W.K. for failure to comply with the order of 9 March 2000. He also asked the court to vary the contact arrangements and to allow him to visit his daughter three times a year, on the first Friday of every fourth month between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\nOn an unknown date the request to impose a fine on W.K. was transferred to the Civil Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court. On 20 October 2005 she was fined (1,000 Polish zlotys (PLN)) for failing to appear at meetings. Her appeal against his decision was dismissed on 15 February 2006.\n\nOn 7 January 2005 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision and dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for modification of the contact arrangements. The court heard the sixteen -year-old M., who stated that she did not wish to have any contact with the applicant. The court held that it was not in the child\u2019s best interest to vary the visiting arrangements."}

Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Adnan Levent \u00c7amlar (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 August 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Cang\u0131, a lawyer practising in \u0130zmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 24 June 2013 the complaints under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d) of the Convention concerning the independence and impartiality of the \u0130zmir State Security Court and the applicant\u2019s inability to examine or have examined witnesses were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and lives in London.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant in the United Kingdom\n\nOn 29 April 1997 the applicant was arrested in London on suspicion of trafficking of illegal drugs.\n\nOn the same day he was placed in police custody, where he was informed that he would be charged with importation of a controlled drug, namely diamorphine.\n\nIn his statements before the British police, the applicant maintained that he had been importing clothing goods from Turkey and had not been aware of the trafficking of drugs by his partners.\n\nOn 15 September 1998, after having heard witness statements and evaluated all relevant evidence, the Crown Court acquitted the applicant of all charges and ordered his release.\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant in Turkey\n\nOn 16 June 1997 the public prosecutor at the \u0130zmir State Security Court filed an indictment with that court, accusing certain persons of trafficking of illegal drugs by establishing a criminal organisation pursuant to Article 403 of the former Criminal Code (Law no. 765). In that indictment, the public prosecutor indicated the involvement of the applicant in the alleged acts, without bringing any charges against him.\n\nOn 19 August 1997 the public prosecutor issued an indictment, accusing the applicant of the same offence as the others. The public prosecutor stated that the applicant had actively participated in the transfer of the illegal drugs from Turkey to the United Kingdom and noted that he was in detention on remand in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn a report dated 13 June 1997, the public prosecutor stated that the British authorities had provided him with the tapes of the applicant\u2019s police statements as well as other evidence on the alleged offence.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 1997, the Magistrates\u2019 Court ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on remand in absentia.\n\nAt a hearing on 24 February 1998 the \u0130zmir State Security Court joined the proceedings against the applicant with the proceedings against the other persons involved in the same offence. At this hearing the domestic court also requested the case file of another set of related proceedings, which contained the statements of a certain F.A.\n\nOn 5 November 1998 one of the co-accused, B.\u04e6., gave his statements before the court, maintaining that he had been hired by the applicant for the receipt and storage of certain goods which he had not known to be drugs.\n\nOn 3 December 1998 the lawyer of one of the co-accused submitted to the national court the applicant\u2019s certificate of acquittal issued by the Crown Court.\n\nOn 15 July 1999 the military judge sitting on the \u0130zmir State Security Court hearing the applicant\u2019s case was replaced by a civilian judge.\n\nOn 20 September 1999 the applicant went back to Turkey; he was placed in detention on remand the following day.\n\nAt the subsequent hearing on 30 September 1999, the applicant submitted his statements before the court and denied his involvement in the trafficking of illegal drugs. In particular, he contested the incriminating statements of B.\u04e6. and F.A. The applicant further requested to have certain witnesses, including his counsel in the United Kingdom, heard. The \u0130zmir State Security Court rejected that request, finding that the statements of the witnesses called by the applicant would not contribute to the case in view of the information already available concerning the proceedings in the United Kingdom. The court went on to decide that the applicant should be released pending trial.\n\nDuring the numerous hearings which followed, the court deferred the examination of the case to the subsequent hearings, awaiting information as regards certain accused in the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the hearing on 18 February 2003, the public prosecutor submitted his written opinion, requesting that the accused be found guilty as charged, mainly on the basis of the investigation conducted in the United Kingdom and the evidence obtained during another set of proceedings concerning the same offence.\n\nOn 21 March 2003 the applicant submitted his written defence to the court and requested his acquittal. He argued that he could not be found guilty on the basis of evidence which according to the British court was insufficient to prove his involvement in the alleged acts.\n\nOn 27 March 2003, on the basis of the investigation conducted by the British authorities, the statements of B.\u04e6. and those made by F.A., which had been taken in another set of proceedings, the \u0130zmir State Security Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twenty four years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine.\n\nOn 31 March 2003 the applicant appealed against that judgment. During the appeal proceedings before the Court of Cassation the applicant submitted that the first instance court had based his conviction on evidence which he could not challenge, in particular the statements made in his absence by B.\u04e6. and F.A.\n\nOn 4 March 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the \u0130zmir State Security Court. The higher court indicated that the offence at issue concerned the exportation of illegal drugs and accordingly the case differed from that concluded in the United Kingdom. The high court dismissed the applicant\u2019s remaining grounds for appeal without further elaboration.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant went to the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), in June 2005, the applicant requested the reassessment of his case and the application of the more favourable clauses in the new Code.\n\nOn 16 December 2005, after having examined the case file, the \u0130zmir Assize Court reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment and decreased the amount of the fine.\n\nOn 28 June 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment, stating that the first-instance court was to hold a hearing.\n\nFollowing several hearings, which the applicant had not attended as he had not returned to Turkey, on 3 July 2008 the \u0130zmir Assize Court sentenced the applicant to twenty years and ten months of imprisonment and a fine pursuant to Article 188 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 5237).\n\nFollowing the applicant\u2019s appeal, on 9 April 2009 the Court of Cassation held a hearing and heard the submissions of the applicant\u2019s lawyer. Finally, the higher court upheld the judgment of the \u0130zmir Assize Court with a minor procedural correction."}

Spain lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Spanish national, Mr Antonio Aldeguer Tom\u00e1s (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 22 June 2009.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr M. R\u00f3denas P\u00e9rez, a lawyer practising in Madrid. The Spanish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr F. Sanz Gand\u00e1segui, State Attorney.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 that he had been discriminated against on the ground of his sexual orientation in that he had been denied a survivor\u2019s pension following the death of his partner, with whom he had lived in a de facto marital relationship for twelve years. In substance the applicant also relied on Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n\nOn 18 October 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nJudge Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra, the judge elected in respect of Spain, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). On 11 February 2015, the President of the Section accordingly appointed Ms Blanca Lozano Cutanda to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 26 \u00a7 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n (Madrid).\n\nThe applicant cohabited with another man in a homosexual relationship from 1990 until the latter\u2019s death on 2 July 2002. During that period they lived together in an apartment belonging to the applicant\u2019s partner. When his partner died, the sister and only heir of the applicant\u2019s partner gave the applicant, because of the relationship he had had with her brother, an apartment that had belonged to the applicant\u2019s late partner and in which the couple had spent their holidays together since 1990.\n\nOn 19 September 2003 the applicant claimed social security allowances as a surviving spouse, under section 174 (1) of the General Social Security Act, arguing that he had cohabited with his deceased partner for many years.\n\nOn 22 September 2003 the National Institute of Social Security (Instituto Nacional de la Seguridad Social, hereafter referred to as \u201cINSS\u201d) refused to grant the applicant a survivor\u2019s pension on the ground that since he had not been married to the deceased person, he could not legally be considered as his surviving spouse for the purposes of section 174 (1) of the General Social Security Act. That decision was formally served on 13 June 2005.\n\nOn 1 July 2005 Law no. 13/2005 amending the provisions of the Civil Code with respect to the right to enter into marriage was passed. Two days later it entered into force. This law legalised same-sex marriage in Spain. In accordance with its first additional provision all legal and regulatory provisions making reference to marriage should be understood thereafter as applicable to all marriages irrespective of the sex of its members (see paragraph 35 below).\n\nOn 5 July 2005 the applicant filed an administrative complaint against the decision of 22 September 2003. This complaint was dismissed by the INSS on 11 August 2005. The INSS noted that there was no provision in the legislation in force that allowed, for the purposes of social security rights, the person who had been cohabiting with the deceased to gain the status of a widower.\n\nOn 26 September 2005 the applicant challenged that decision before the Madrid Social Tribunal no. 33 (\u201cthe Social Tribunal\u201d).\n\nIn a judgment of 14 November 2005 the Social Tribunal ruled for the applicant. The Social Tribunal firstly outlined that the facts of the case had to be assessed in the light of the newly enacted Law no. 13/2005, which was already in force and deemed constitutional by the tribunal. As to the merits, the Social Tribunal observed that the issue at stake was whether the applicant, as the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship that ended (following his partner\u2019s death) before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, had the right to a survivor\u2019s pension. The Social Tribunal then reiterated that, according to the well-established domestic case-law, surviving partners of unmarried couples were not entitled to a survivor\u2019s pension under section 174 of the General Social Security Act, marriage being a constitutive element to access any such social-security benefit; that the applicant had been prevented from marrying his partner because same-sex marriage had not been recognised in domestic law at the time his partner died; that the social security administration had relied on the fact that the couple had not married to refuse the applicant a survivor\u2019s pension; and that it was evident that after the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, surviving spouses of same-sex marriages were entitled to survivors\u2019 pensions on the same footing as survivors of different-sex marriages.\n\nThe Social Tribunal was of the view that the solution to the legal issue raised by the applicant\u2019s case depended on whether it could be inferred from Law no. 13/2005 that Parliament\u2019s intention had been that surviving partners of same-sex couples who had been prevented from marrying under the former legislation could access a survivor\u2019s pension on a similar footing to same-sex couples who could marry after the entering into force of that Act. The Social Tribunal drew attention in this regard to the provisions and the explanatory memorandum of Law no. 13/2005 to contend that this new legislation had a very strong egalitarian purpose, and that from the date it entered into force, that is to say 3 July 2005, all legal provisions concerning marriage should be interpreted on the basis of the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 as applying fully to same-sex marriage (see paragraph 35 below). The Social Tribunal held in this regard that: \u201cThis is a wide-ranging provision which affects all the other provisions of the legal system making reference to marriage. From now onwards all references to marriage established in the law shall be understood as applying also to marriage celebrated between two persons of the same sex. Accordingly, whoever shall be called to interpret or apply any marriage-related provision should do so in egalitarian terms without taking into consideration whether the spouses are of the same or different sex\u201d.\n\nThe Social Tribunal further recalled that additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 of 7 July 1981 amending the provisions of the Civil Code pertaining to marriage and the procedure to be followed for cases of annulment, judicial separation and divorce, recognised the right to obtain a survivor\u2019s pension for individuals who had been prevented from marrying a person who later died by the legislation in force until then, provided that he or she had cohabited in a relationship similar to marriage with the deceased person and that the deceased had died before Law no. 30/1981 entered into force.\n\nThe Social Tribunal stressed that such a provision was included in order to provide a solution for those cohabiting couples consisting of a man and a woman who could not have married under the legislation in force until that time, and thus did not qualify for a survivor\u2019s pension, because one or even both of them had still been married to another person whom they had been prevented from divorcing, divorce having been legally impossible in Spain until the passing of Law no. 30/1981. The Social Tribunal considered that the applicant\u2019s circumstances were \u201cfully comparable\u201d to those outlined in additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 in so far as: \u201c- the claimant could not marry his partner because the legislation then in force prevented him from doing so;\n\nthe claimant had shared a marital life with his partner until the latter\u2019s death;\n\nthe latter\u2019s death had taken place before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005\u201d\n\nThe Social Tribunal acknowledged, however, that whereas Law no. 30/1981 was aimed at protecting the rights of those cohabiting heterosexual couples who were prevented from marrying because divorce was prohibited at the time, Law no. 13/2005 was aimed at protecting the rights of those who could not marry on account of their sexual orientation, and that this distinction was the main impediment to the recognition of the applicant\u2019s right to a survivor\u2019s pension.\n\nThe Social Tribunal considered nonetheless that treating these two groups differently would not be in harmony with the strong egalitarian intention expressed by Parliament with the passing of Law no. 13/2005 and that, accordingly, additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was applicable to the applicant by force of additional provision no. 1 of Law no. 13/2005. The Social Tribunal stated as follows: \u201cTherefore, the interpretation that in my opinion better fits the legislature\u2019s intention is the following:\n\nIf the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 sets out that provisions making reference to marriage shall apply irrespective of the sex of the spouses,\n\nAnd one of [these provisions], currently in force to provide access to a survivor\u2019s pension, is additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981.\n\nThe only method to apply it in a way which is consistent with the egalitarian intention of the legislature is to do so irrespective of the sexual orientation of the members of the cohabiting couple.\n\nIn order to ensure that sexual orientation does not constitute discriminatory grounds in the application of additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981, the right thereby recognised shall currently be interpreted as providing a solution to factual situations such as the one in the instant case in which the impediment to access to a survivor\u2019s pension is no other than the sexual orientation [of the claimant].\u201d\n\nAs regards the administration\u2019s submission that in the area of social security benefits the governing principle was that of non-retroactivity of laws and that according to the law in force at the time the applicant\u2019s partner died the former did not qualify for a survivor\u2019s pension because they were not married, the Social Tribunal was of the view that this general principle was not absolute and that it did not apply where there was a specific rule giving retroactive effect to laws more favourable to the citizens, as is true of the instant case. Thus, additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 should be read in the light of the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005.\n\nAs to the degree of retroactivity that should be given to additional provision 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 in the applicant\u2019s case, the Social Tribunal relied on the constitutive effects of Law no. 13/2005 which created new rights and was effective only from the date it entered into force. Accordingly, the Social Tribunal recognised the applicant\u2019s right to be awarded a survivor\u2019s pension with effect from 3 July 2005.\n\nThe INSS and the Treasury General of Social Security appealed (recurso de suplicaci\u00f3n) against that judgment to the Madrid High Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justicia).\n\nOn 18 September 2006 the Madrid High Court of Justice upheld the appeal and reversed the first-instance judgment. The court found that the legislature had not intended Law no. 13/2005 to cover same-sex partnerships which had been ended by the death of one of the partners before said law had entered into force and that the lack of protection of these unions could not be considered discriminatory in the light of Article 14 of the Spanish Constitution.\n\nFor the court, it was only as from the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005 that marriage between same-sex couples was recognised and that this law affected other rights for those persons who would wish to marry thereafter. Hence, the court was of the view that Law no. 13/2005 had no retroactive effects, except as otherwise expressly provided, which was not the case at hand.\n\nThe court further stated that even though Law no. 13/2005 had been inspired by the constitutional principle of equality, prior legislation preventing same-sex marriage could not be deemed unconstitutional as contrary to either any constitutional principle or to the right not to be discriminated against. The court referred to constitutional case-law dating from 1994 according to which the requisite of heterosexuality for the purposes of marriage was fully constitutional and that it was within the margin of appreciation of the public authorities to treat heterosexual marriages more favourably than homosexual partnerships. In this connection, the court maintained that despite the reference in the preamble of Law no. 13/2005 (see paragraph 35 below) to the discriminatory treatment to which homosexuals had traditionally been subjected on account of their sexual orientation, the aim of Parliament in passing that law was merely to respond to a new social reality and award homosexuals the right to marry, but not to protect same-sex partnerships which had already ended before its enactment.\n\nThe court referred to constitutional case-law according to which a difference in legal treatment of individuals due to subsequent changes in the law does not necessarily entail discrimination, even if those persons could be said to be in similar circumstances. Given the complexity that a change in legislation might involve, it was for Parliament to establish the characteristics of the legal transition, either by introducing retroactivity clauses or by restricting the application of the new legislation to circumstances arising after its entry into force.\n\nThe court noted in this regard that Law no. 13/2005 had not included any provision concerning same-sex partnerships which had already ended at the time of its entry into force and that it strictly concerned same-sex couples still in existence at that time and who would be willing to enter into marriage. The court considered that the difference between the situations before and after the passing of Law no. 13/2005 was essentially an expression of the principle of succession of laws without constitutional implications as regards the right not to be discriminated against.\n\nAs regards the applicability to the present case of additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981, the Madrid High Court of Justice found that this provision was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case for two main reasons. Firstly, that provision could not be considered as among the provisions to which the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 referred. Additional provision no. 10 (2) was, as the Constitutional Court had established, of a provisional or transitory nature and had been envisaged for those specific cases in which one of the partners had died before the entry into force of Law no. 30/1981. It had not been intended to govern future situations. Secondly, that provision had been envisaged for a totally different situation from that of the applicant. Additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was aimed at guaranteeing a survivor\u2019s pension to those heterosexuals who had been prevented from marrying their out-of wedlock partner because divorce had not been legal at the time of the latter\u2019s death. The inability to remarry for those affected by additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was based on the fact that divorce was not permitted at the time. The institution of marriage was open to them in their capacity as heterosexuals. On the contrary, same-sex couples were absolutely prevented from marrying before Law no. 13/2005 since the institution of marriage was until then restricted to heterosexual couples.\n\nFurthermore, the court contended that the applicant could never have fulfilled the more uxorio marital cohabitation requirement established by additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/ 1981 of, because only those who were in principle eligible for marriage but had been prevented from marrying for whatever reason could qualify for de facto marital cohabitation. The applicant and his partner could have never cohabited \u201cas if married\u201d before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, because before then they were ineligible for marriage as they were both male.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal on points of law seeking harmonisation of the case-law (recurso de casaci\u00f3n para la unificaci\u00f3n de doctrina). In a decision of 27 June 2007, the Supreme Court (Social Chamber) declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the decision produced for purposes of comparison, specifically a judgment of the High Court of Justice of the Canary Islands of 7 November 2003, was not relevant. That decision was served on 26 July 2007.\n\nRelying on Articles 14 (principle of equality and prohibition of discrimination) and 24 \u00a7 1 (right to effective judicial protection), the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. In a decision of 11 February 2009, served on 17 February 2009, the Constitutional Court declared the appeal inadmissible on the grounds that the applicant had failed to substantiate the special constitutional relevance of his complaints."}

the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nThe first applicant, Mr Douglas Gary Vinter, is a British national who was born in 1969 and is currently detained at HMP Frankland. He is represented before the Court by Mr S. Creighton, a lawyer practising in London with Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, assisted by Mr P. Weatherby, counsel, and Professor D. van Zyl Smit.\n\nThe second applicant, Mr Jeremy Neville Bamber, is a British national who was born in 1961 and is currently detained at HMP Full Sutton. He is represented before the Court by Mr B. Woods, a lawyer practising in Leeds with Cousins Tyrer Solicitors, assisted by Mr R. Horwell QC and Mr L.

He is represented before the Court by Chivers Solicitors, Bingley, assisted by Mr M. McKone, counsel.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms L. Dauban of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicants alleged that the whole life orders which had been imposed on them violated Articles 3, 5 \u00a7 4, 6 and 7 of the Convention.\n\nOn 1 February 2011, the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nA. Introduction\n\nSince the abolition of the death penalty in England and Wales, the sentence for murder has been a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. When such a sentence is imposed, it is the current practice, in the majority of cases, for the trial judge to set a minimum term of imprisonment which must be served before the prisoner is eligible for release on licence. Exceptionally, however, \u201ca whole life order\u201d may be imposed by the trial judge instead of a minimum term. This has the effect that the prisoner cannot be released other than at the discretion of the Secretary of State. (The power of the Secretary of State to release a prisoner is provided for in section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.) The Secretary of State will only exercise his discretion on compassionate grounds when the prisoner is terminally ill or seriously incapacitated (see Prison Service Order 4700 set out at paragraph 36 below).\n\nPrior to the entry into force of the 2003 Act, it was the practice for the mandatory life sentence to be passed by the trial judge but for the Secretary of State, after receiving recommendations from the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice, to decide the minimum term of imprisonment which the prisoner would have to serve before he would be eligible for early release on licence. This was also referred to as the \u201ctariff\u201d part of the sentence and was taken to represent the minimum period which the prisoner was required to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. It was open to the Secretary of State to impose a whole life tariff on a prisoner. In such a case, it was the practice of the Secretary of State to review a whole life tariff after twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment to determine whether it was still justified, particularly with reference to cases where the prisoner had made exceptional progress in prison (see Hindley at paragraph 39 below). With the entry into force of the 2003 Act (and, in particular, section 276 and schedule 22 to the Act), all prisoners whose tariffs were set by the Secretary of State have been able to apply to the High Court for review of that tariff. Upon such an application the High Court may set a minimum term of imprisonment or make a whole life order.\n\nThis case concerns three applicants who, having been convicted of murder in separate criminal proceedings in England and Wales, are currently serving mandatory sentences of life imprisonment. All three applicants have been given whole life orders: in the first applicant\u2019s case this order was made by the trial judge under the current practice; in the case of the second and third applicants, who were convicted and sentenced prior to the entry into force of the 2003 Act, the orders were made by the High Court. All three applicants maintain that these whole life orders, as they apply to their cases, are incompatible inter alia with Articles 3 and 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. The facts of the applications, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nB. Mr Vinter\n\nOn 20 May 1996, the first applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a work colleague, with a minimum term of 10 years. He was released on licence on 4 August 2005.\n\nHe began living with a woman who was to become the victim of his second murder offence. The couple married on 27 June 2006. On 31 December 2006 the first applicant was involved in a fight in a public house and charged with affray (using or threatening unlawful violence). His licence was revoked and he was recalled to prison. In July 2007, having pleaded guilty to the charge of affray, he was sentenced to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment. He was released on licence again in December 2007 and returned to live with his wife and her four children. The couple became estranged and the first applicant left the marital home.\n\nOn 5 February 2008, the first applicant followed his wife to a public house. He had been drinking and had taken cocaine. The couple argued and the wife\u2019s daughter, who was present, telephoned the police to alert them to the dispute. The first applicant ordered his wife to get into a car. When the daughter tried to get into the car to protect her mother, the first applicant forcibly removed her. He then drove off with his wife. When the police telephoned her to ascertain if she was safe, the first applicant forced his wife to tell them that she was fine. The first applicant also telephoned the police to tell them that his wife was safe and well. Some hours later he gave himself up to the police, telling them that he had killed her. A post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had a broken nose, deep and extensive bruising to her neck (which was consistent with attempted strangulation), and four stab wounds to the chest. Two knives were found at the scene, one of which had a broken blade.\n\nThe first applicant pleaded guilty to murder and instructed his counsel not to make any submissions in mitigation lest it add to the grief of the victim\u2019s family. The trial judge considered that the first applicant fell into that small category of people who should be deprived permanently of their liberty. He passed the mandatory life sentence and made a whole life order.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on 25 June 2009. It considered the general principles for determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence (as set out in schedule 21 to the 2003 Act: see relevant domestic law and practice below). It found that, given the circumstances of the offence, there was no reason whatever to depart from the normal principle enshrined in schedule 21 to the 2003 Act that, where murder was committed by someone who was already a convicted murderer, a whole life order was appropriate for punishment and deterrence.\n\nC. Mr Bamber\n\nOn 7 August 1985, the second applicant\u2019s parents, his adoptive sister and her two young children were shot and killed. The second applicant was subsequently charged and, on 28 October 1986, convicted of the murders. The prosecution\u2019s case was that the murders were premeditated and planned and had been committed for financial gain. It was also alleged that the second applicant had arranged the crime scene so as to mislead the police by making it appear as if his adoptive sister had killed the family and then herself.\n\nThe trial judge recommended to the Secretary of State that the second applicant serve twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment \u201cas a minimum\u201d (his underlining). On the trial judge\u2019s letter to the Secretary of State, the Lord Chief Justice added the comment \u201cfor my part I would never release him\u201d. In 1988, the Secretary of State imposed a whole life tariff. The practice at the time was not to inform the prisoner of this decision. By letter dated 15 December 1994, the applicant was informed that the Secretary of State had concluded that the requirements of retribution and deterrence could only be satisfied by the second applicant remaining in prison for the whole of his life.\n\nIn 2008, following the entry into force of section 276 and schedule 22 to the 2003 Act, the second applicant applied to the High Court for review of the whole life tariff. Having regard to schedule 21 to the Act, the High Court concluded that, given the number of murders involved and the presence of premeditation by the second applicant, the offence plainly fell within that category of cases where the appropriate starting point was a whole life order. Having further regard to statements submitted by the victims\u2019 next-of-kin and submissions by the second applicant, including reports as to the behaviour and progress he had made in prison, the High Court found that there was no reason to depart from the views of the Lord Chief Justice and the Secretary of State. It therefore imposed a whole life order.\n\nThe second applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal on 14 May 2009. The court found that, when the Secretary of State had set a whole life tariff in 1988, he had been provided with two different judicial recommendations: one from the trial judge recommending a minimum term of twenty-five years and one from the Lord Chief Justice recommending that the second applicant should never be released. The Secretary of State had been entitled to choose between those recommendations or to adopt neither of them. The Court of Appeal also found that the whole life order imposed by the High Court was not only correct but, for the purposes of punishment and retribution, fully justified.\n\nRelying on its previous judgment in R v. Bieber (see paragraph 40 below), it found that no issue arose under Article 3 of the Convention as the whole life order was not an irreducible life sentence as that term had been used in Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, ECHR 2008\u2011... Finally, following its ruling in R v. Pitchfork (see paragraph 41 below) it found that the review procedure created by the 2003 Act was compatible with Article 7 of the Convention as, properly construed, the relevant statutory provisions meant a prisoner could not be disadvantaged by the outcome of the review: the term to be served could be reduced, or maintained, but it could not be increased or extended.\n\nThe second applicant applied to the Court of Appeal to certify that its judgment concerned a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by the House of Lords. That application was refused on 23 June 2009.\n\nD. Mr Moore\n\nOn 29 November 1996 the third applicant was convicted after trial in the Crown Court at Chester of four counts of murder. The victims were homosexual men and the applicant, himself a homosexual, was alleged to have committed the murders for his own sexual gratification. Each victim was stabbed many times with a large combat knife which the third applicant had bought for that purpose. The first victim was attacked in his home on 23 September 1995. Soon after, on the weekend of 7 October 1995, the third applicant met his second victim in a bar and arranged to take him home for sex; he instead took him to a forest, stabbed him to death and left the body there. The third victim was stabbed in the caravan where he lived on 30 November 1995. Finally, shortly before Christmas 1995, the third applicant went to a beach which was well-known for homosexual trysts. He met the fourth victim on the beach and stabbed him there.\n\nBlood from the first and third victims was found on the third applicant\u2019s jacket and on the knife. Property from the first, second and fourth victims was found in his possession. He made extensive admissions about all four murders to the police. The police had been unaware of the second victim until the third applicant mentioned him to them. The body was recovered from the forest with his assistance. At trial, the applicant\u2019s defence was that the murders had been committed by someone else, though he admitted to having been present at all the murders save for that of the second victim.\n\nAfter the third applicant was convicted, the trial judge passed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and recommended to the Secretary of State for the Home Department that, in his view, the applicant should never be released. Upon review, the Lord Chief Justice reported that he thought the minimum period before eligibility for release should be set at thirty years. On 27 September 2002, the Secretary of State decided to set a whole life tariff.\n\nIn 2008, pursuant to section 276 and schedule 22 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the third applicant applied to the High Court for review of the whole life tariff set by the Secretary of State. In its judgment of 12 June 2008 the High Court rejected the third applicant\u2019s submission that it should accept the Lord Chief Justice\u2019s recommendation of a minimum term of thirty years. It found that, while weight should be accorded to that recommendation, the Lord Chief Justice did not have regard to the principles set out in schedule 21 as the High Court was required to do. It also rejected the submission that an issue arose under Article 6 given that a whole life tariff had been set by the Secretary of State. The High Court found that the procedure for applying to the High Court under section 276 and schedule 22 of the Act provided the necessary independent review as to whether a prisoner should be released. The court also found that a whole life order would be compatible with Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. Having regard to the general principles for determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence (as set out in schedule 21 to the Act), no issue of arbitrariness arose and whether such a sentence was disproportionate depended on the facts of each case.\n\nThe High Court found that, since the case involved the murder of two or more persons, sexual or sadistic conduct and a substantial degree of premeditation, under schedule 21 the starting point was a whole life order. There were no mitigating features and even the Lord Chief Justice, in recommending a minimum term of thirty years, had shared the trial judge\u2019s view that it might never be safe to release the third applicant. There were no reasons, therefore, to mitigate the starting point of a whole life order. The High Court added that, even if the starting point were a minimum term of thirty years, the aggravating features of the murders were such as to make a whole life order appropriate.\n\nOn 26 February 2009, the Court of Appeal dismissed the third applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that the High Court was not only entitled, but clearly right, to conclude that a whole life order was appropriate.\n\nIt appears that the third applicant, in order to allow him to appeal to the House of Lords, then applied to the Court of Appeal to certify that its judgment concerned a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by the House of Lords. On 14 August 2009, he was informed by the Court of Appeal\u2019s Criminal Appeal Office that, because the Court of Appeal had refused his application for permission to appeal against sentence (as opposed to granting permission to appeal against sentence and then dismissing the appeal), an application to certify a point of law for the House of Lords could not be made."}

applications (nos. 27080/08 and 40982/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Metin K\u00f6ksal and Mr Servet Durdu (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 29 May and 15 August 2008, respectively. The first applicant, Mr K\u00f6ksal, was represented by Mr H. \u00c7ak\u0131ro\u011flu, a lawyer practising in Samsun. The second applicant, Mr Durdu, was represented by Mr M. Bayat, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 May 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nThe applicants were born in 1973 and 1965, respectively, and live in Samsun and Ankara.\n\nA. Application no. 27080/08\n\nOn 17 October 2001 the applicant was discharged from his civil service post following his previous criminal conviction by a martial law court. The conviction had been finalised by the Military Court of Cassation's decision of 11 November 1997.\n\nOn 4 January 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Samsun Administrative Court to annul the discharge order.\n\nOn 5 June 2002 the Samsun Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request.\n\nOn 7 February 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Samsun Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur (\u201ctetkik hakimi\u201d) concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 31 December 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for rectification of its previous decision.\n\nB. Application no. 40982/08\n\nOn 11 January 2002 the applicant was discharged from his civil service post after a disciplinary decision. Criminal proceedings were also commenced against the applicant on the same grounds as those which had led to his discharge.\n\nOn 15 March 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Ankara Administrative Court to annul the discharge order.\n\nOn 25 June 2002 the Ankara Assize Court acquitted the applicant of the offences with which he had been charged. On 22 March 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's acquittal.\n\nIn the meantime, on 31 March 2003 the Ankara Administrative Court refused the applicant's request to annul the discharge order. Relying on Section 131 of the Law on Civil Servants (Law no. 657), the administrative court held that the applicant's acquittal of the criminal charges did not absolve him from the disciplinary sanction.\n\nOn 26 April 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 23 January 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's rectification request. The final decision was served on the applicant on 4 March 2008."}

Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Andrzej Pisk-Piskowski (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 13 November 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 24 March 2004 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Opole, Poland.\n\nA. The criminal proceedings\n\nIn 1998 the prosecution service filed with the Opole District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) a bill of indictment in which it charged the applicant with making unlawful threats. In the course of the court proceedings the applicant was represented by a court-appointed lawyer. On 6 November 2001 the trial court held a hearing at which the applicant and his court\u2011appointed lawyer were present. During the hearing, the court scheduled the next hearing for 4 December 2001 about which the applicant was informed.\n\nOn 4 December 2001 a hearing took place before the trial court. The applicant did not attend the hearing but his counsel was present. The applicant failed to give any reasons for his absence and the trial court finished the proceedings and decided in the presence of the counsel that the judgment would be delivered on 11 December 2001.\n\nOn 11 December 2001 the Opole District Court delivered a judgment in which it convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to a prison term of one year and six months. Neither the applicant nor his counsel was present at the delivery of the judgment.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal against the judgment of 11 December 2001 and did not apply for a copy of the reasons of that judgment.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant lodged an application for leave to apply for a reasoned judgment out of time. In his application, he argued that his absence at the hearing held on 4 December 2001 was justified because he had been recently released from the detention and on 5 December 2001 he had been assaulted. The applicant also complained that he had not been informed about the date of the delivery of the judgment. On 9 April 2002 the Opole District Court examined the application and dismissed it. The court, in a reasoned decision, established that the applicant had known about the hearing scheduled for 4 December 2001. He failed to attend it without providing any justification for his absence. Therefore, the trial court was entitled to terminate the proceedings in his absence on the basis of Article 376 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court further examined the reasons for the absence submitted by the applicant. It established that in fact he had been released on 22 November 2001 - two weeks prior to the hearing. Moreover, while it was true that the applicant had been assaulted, nevertheless, that had happened the day following the hearing and the injuries sustained by the applicant, according to a hospital certificate, were not serious and the applicant was not admitted to hospital. With regard to the complaint that he was not informed about the date of the delivery of the judgment, the court found that the applicant had not been diligent since he had not contacted his lawyer. The applicant was aware of the scheduled hearing and knew the address and the name of his court\u2011appointed lawyer. The applicant appealed against this decision. On 16 May 2003 the Opole Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) examined the reasons given by the District Court and upheld the decision.\n\nOn 14 January 2002 the applicant started serving the prison sentence ordered by the judgment of 11 December 2001.\n\nB. The monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence\n\nOn 6 December 2002 the Court received the applicant\u2019s first letter dated 13 November 2002. The letter was sent while the applicant was serving a prison sentence in the Wroc\u0142aw Detention Centre. The envelope in which the letter was delivered bears the following stamps: \u201cDistrict Court in Legnica, censored on 22.11.02\u201d (S\u0105d Rejonowy w Legnicy, cenzurowano dnia 22.11.02) and \u201c252, 14 NOV 2002, register number 2738/01\u201d (252, 14 LIS 2002, numer ewid. 2738/01)."}

case was referred to the Court, within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c), by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 16 May 1983 and then by the Government of the Republic of Austria (\u201cthe Government\u201c) on 25 May 1983. The case originated in an application (no. 8790/79) against Austria lodged with the Commission on 19 September 1979 under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mrs. Viera Sramek, a United States citizen. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the Republic of Austria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46), and the Government\u2019s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The purpose of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\n\nIn response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. G. Wiarda, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b) of the Rules of Court). On 27 May 1983, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Deputy Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr. D. Evrigenis, Sir Vincent Evans and Mr. C. Russo (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nHaving assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and having on each occasion consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and Mrs. Sramek\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Wiarda\n\ndecided, on 13 June 1983, that there was no call for memorials to be filed (Rule 37 para. 1);\n\ndirected, on 17 November, that the oral proceedings should open on 24 January 1984 (Rule 38). The Registrar, acting on the President\u2019s instructions, requested the Commission to produce certain documents, which were received on 29 November 1983. On 13 and 14 December, the applicant filed her claims under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention. On 17 December, the President granted the applicant\u2019s lawyer leave to use the German language (Rule 27 para. 3).\n\nThe hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before they opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr. H. T\u00fcrk, Legal Adviser in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. M. Matzka, Federal Chancellery, Mr. G. Liebl, Office of the Government of the Tyrol, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr. F. Ermacora, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr. E. Proksch, Rechtsanwalt, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr. T\u00fcrk and Mr. Matzka for the Government, by Mr. Ermacora for the Commission and by Mr. Proksch for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions. During the course of the hearings, the Government filed a document.\n\nFollowing deliberations held on 26 January, the Chamber decided under Rule 50 of the Rules of Court to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court. Having taken note of the agreement of the Agent of the Government and the concurring opinion of the Commission\u2019s Delegate and Mrs. Sramek\u2019s lawyer, the Court decided on 27 March that the proceedings should continue without resumption of the hearings (Rule 26).\n\nVarious documents were produced to the Court by the Government on 6 February, 27 March and 25 April, and by the applicant on 1 and 7 February and 28 March. The Government also replied on 27 March to two supplementary questions which the Registrar had addressed to them on the instructions of the President.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who is a United States citizen, lives in Munich in the Federal Republic of Germany. Wishing to build a holiday residence in Hopfgarten, a village in the Austrian Tyrol, she approached, with the assistance of municipal officials, the owners of a plot of land which had until then been used for agricultural purposes. Sale negotiations began in 1971 and apparently led, in 1973, to an initial contract. One year later, Mrs. Sramek paid to the vendors the greater part of the agreed price. However, the definitive contract was not drawn up until 13 January 1977.\n\nUnder section 3 of the Tyrolean Real Property Transactions Act (Grundverkehrsgesetz) 1970, as amended by, inter alia, an Act of 28 November 1973 which came into force on 1 January 1974 (\u201cthe 1970/1973 Act\u201c), the contract could not take effect unless it were approved by the local Real Property Transactions Authority (Grundverkehrsbeh\u00f6rde); in fact, it contained a clause which so provided. The 1970/1973 Act applies to agricultural and forestry land and also to any land over which rights are acquired by, in particular, a natural person who does not possess Austrian nationality (section 1(1) and (2)).\n\nThe local Real Property Transactions Authority for Hopfgarten at the office of the Kitzb\u00fchel District Administration (Bezirkshauptmannschaft), to which the contract had been submitted, approved it on 7 March 1977; the decision (Bescheid) was dated 31 March.\n\nOn 6 April, the Real Property Transactions Officer (Landesgrundverkehrsreferent, \u201cthe Transactions Officer\u201c, see paragraph 23 below) at the Government Office of the Tyrol (Amt der Landesregierung) in Innsbruck exercised his right of appeal (Berufung) to the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority (Landesgrundverkehrsbeh\u00f6rde; section 13(3) of the 1970/1973 Act and see paragraphs 22-23 below). In his view, the contract fell foul of section 4(2) of the 1970/1973 Act. Under that sub-section, where the purchaser of real property is a foreigner a contract of the kind in question can be approved only \u201cif the acquisition of rights (Rechtserwerb) is not contrary to political (staatspolitisch), economic, social (sozialpolitisch) or cultural interests; such a conflict (Widerspruch) is deemed to exist, in particular, where, (a) having regard to the extent of existing foreign ownership or to the number of foreign owners, there is a risk of foreign domination (Uberfremdung) in the municipality or locality concerned, (b) ... .\u201c In the submission of the Transactions Officer, there were, in fact, already 110 foreign landowners in Hopfgarten and it could be seen from a series of decisions of the Regional Authority that this municipality was one of those where the danger of foreign domination was imminent. The contract in question was therefore contrary to social and economic interests within the meaning of the above-mentioned Act. The applicant received a copy of the appeal but did not file any observations in reply.\n\nThe Government Office of the Tyrol was organised in a number of \u201cgroups\u201c and each group comprised several \u201cdivisions\u201c. In the present case, the Transactions Officer was the director of group III; his secretariat was provided by one of the seven divisions in that group, namely division III b. 2.\n\nOn 3 June 1977, the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority at the Government Office of the Tyrol held a hearing. The Regional Authority sat in camera but the parties, namely the Transactions Officer and Mrs. Sramek, were present. The latter appeared in person, without the assistance of a lawyer. In accordance with section 13(4), no. 1, of the 1970/1973 Act (see paragraph 24 below), the Regional Authority was composed as follows: the elected mayor of a municipality in the Tyrol, who was a farmer experienced in real estate matters, as chairman; a judge of the Innsbruck Court of Appeal; a civil servant from division III b. 3 - one of the seven divisions in group III - of the Government Office, as rapporteur; the head of group III d; the director of the Regional Forestry Service, being the head of group III f; a farmer; and a lawyer. The secretariat was provided by division III b. 3, to which the rapporteur belonged.\n\nAccording to the minutes of the hearing, the rapporteur presented the facts and read out the expert opinions and observations received during the course of the investigation; the latter concerned, inter alia, the percentage of the parcels of land in Hopfgarten which was in foreign hands. The Transactions Officer then requested the Authority to uphold his appeal on the ground that as there was already a risk of foreign domination in Hopfgarten, the acquisition of the land in question would be contrary to social and political interests. The applicant stated that she had signed the initial contract (Erstvertrag), which could not then be found, on 13 March 1973. As early as 23 January 1971, she had reached an agreement to purchase (Vertragsabsprachen) and had received assurances that all would go well. Since that time, she had come to Austria several times each year to settle the matter. Her husband was living with the family in Munich, where he worked, but would be retiring shortly. She declared that she herself was prepared to apply for Austrian nationality. Their permit to reside in the Federal Republic was temporary and she did not wish to return to the United States. She added that she had already made a first payment of 111,591 schillings. In conclusion, she requested that the contract be approved.\n\nOn the same day, that is 3 June 1977, the Regional Authority upheld the appeal: referring to the above-mentioned section 4(2)(a) of the 1970/1973 Act, it refused to approve the transfer of title. Its decision (Bescheid) was dated 16 June. The Authority noted firstly that according to a statement from the municipality of Hopfgarten, which had not been challenged at the hearing, there were 110 foreign landowners in Hopfgarten, owning 5.6 hectares of land. There were 4,800 inhabitants and 1,100 families in the locality, though not all of them were landowners. The proportion of non-Austrian owners already exceeded 10 per cent and the extent of their holdings revealed a tendency towards foreign domination. The Authority then recalled that for some years past it had been refusing to approve the transfer of land in Hopfgarten to foreigners since it had concluded that there was a risk of foreign domination in the area. It had to take account, inter alia, of the effects of its decision on third parties. According to the Authority, experience showed that the approval of a contract between a landowner and a foreigner led to an influx of other foreigners who also wished to buy land in the locality. This caused prices to rise substantially, making it very difficult, if not impossible, for the indigenous population to find housing for themselves. For these reasons and in view of the scarcity of building plots in the Tyrol, very strict legal (gesetzlich) control had to be exercised: sales and purchases could normally be approved only if they contributed to the establishment or maintenance of an effective (leistungsf\u00e4hig) agricultural population or if they served to satisfy domestic land needs (inl\u00e4ndischer Bodenbedarf) for any kind of public or social purposes. However, Mrs. Sramek was intending to use the land in question - at least for some time - for the construction of a holiday residence. Such an objective could easily be satisfied by the local hotel trade which, furthermore, was losing potential customers as a result of the construction of villas by foreigners. The acquisition contemplated was therefore prejudicial to economic and social interests and thus fell foul of, in particular, section 4(2)(a) of the 1970/1973 Act. Lastly, the Regional Authority rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that she had already concluded a contract in 1973, that is at a time when American citizens were treated on an equal footing with Austrians by virtue of a bilateral treaty dating from 1928. The Authority emphasised firstly that it had to base itself on the factual and legal situation obtaining at the time when the decision had to be taken. In its view, the 1928 treaty had not established any equality between citizens of the two States in the area concerned. In the case in question, the transfer of ownership contemplated fell under Article 1 para. 2, as interpreted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a 1973 memorandum which stated that the general regulations with regard to foreigners were applicable. Even if this interpretation had not been known at the time when the initial contract had allegedly been concluded (13 March 1973, see paragraph 14 above) - though this was not the case, since the above-mentioned memorandum dated from early 1973 -, Mrs. Sramek could not claim that she had acted in good faith: she was obliged under section 15 of the 1970/1973 Act to seek approval of the contract within two months and she alone bore the responsibility for not having done so.\n\nOn 22 August 1977, the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) against the decision of the Regional Authority. She claimed that her right to inviolability of property and her right to a decision by the legally competent court (gesetzlicher Richter) had been infringed and relied on Article 5 of the Basic Law (Staatsgrundgesetz), Article 83 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) and Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. As concerns the first complaint, Mrs. Sramek alleged that the Regional Authority had applied section 4(2)(a) of the 1970/1973 Act in a misconceived (denkunm\u00f6glich) manner by adopting an illogical approach; amongst other things, it had concluded that there was a danger of foreign domination in Hopfgarten without being in possession of detailed documentation, without defining the risk in question and without enquiring into the actual position in Hopfgarten regarding real property ownership. She further contended that the Regional Authority was not an \u201cindependent tribunal\u201c within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. On these grounds, she requested the Constitutional Court to annul the decision under appeal or, in the alternative, to refer the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). Mrs. Sramek supplemented her grounds of appeal on 9 March 1978. She asserted that her lawyer had not been able to consult the minutes of the Regional Authority\u2019s deliberations. She had, in fact, learnt that the Authority had not given its ruling on 3 June 1977, immediately after the closure of the hearing. She inferred from this that the decision complained of had not been taken by the legally competent court. She requested the Constitutional Court to provide her lawyer with an opportunity of reading the above-mentioned minutes.\n\nThe Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal on 3 March 1979 (Erkenntnisse und Beschl\u00fcsse des Verfassungsgerichtshofes, 1979, vol. 44, no. 8501). It took the view that the Regional Authority was indeed a \u201ctribunal\u201c within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. It gave decisions which the executive could neither annul nor vary. As regards its members - who included a judge -, they had a degree of independence equal to that of judges. They were not bound by any instructions in the exercise of their functions and they could not be removed during their three-year term of office, except for reasons which would have precluded their appointment or if they were permanently prevented from carrying out their duties. The Constitutional Court accordingly held that Article 6 (art. 6) had not been violated. The applicant\u2019s other ground of appeal was also rejected. Recalling that it had already held in another case, in 1974, that it was not misconceived to conclude that there was a danger of foreign domination in Hopfgarten, the Constitutional Court stated that it saw no reason to change its opinion in the instant case. As regards the facts noted by the Regional Authority, they had not been the subject of any dispute during the administrative proceedings. The Constitutional Court sat in camera and gave judgment without holding a hearing.\n\nEven before the above-mentioned judgment had been delivered, the plot in question was sold to an Austrian who, according to the Government, turned it back into grazing-land. The Regional Authority had taken the view that it could examine the new contract, provided that its decision was held in abeyance pending the outcome of the Constitutional Court\u2019s proceedings.\n\nThe Government stated that during the last ten years or so the Regional Authority had not approved any acquisition of real property in Hopfgarten by a foreigner. They supplied a list of thirteen refusals in the period between July 1973 and February 1983; according to the applicant, the list was insufficiently detailed to be conclusive.\n\nII. RELEVANT LEGISLATION\n\nUnder Article 15 of the Federal Constitution, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court, the regulation of real property transactions is a matter coming within the jurisdiction of the L\u00e4nder. Most of the L\u00e4nder have enacted legislation whereby all contracts relating to agricultural or forestry land and also, in some cases, real property transactions with foreigners have to be approved by special authorities.\n\nIn the Tyrol (see paragraph 9 above), section 15(1) of the 1970/1973 Act obliges the purchaser to seek such approval within two months of the conclusion of the contract. No entry can be made in the land register until the transaction has been approved by the competent authority (section 1(4)). If approval is withheld, the acquisition is null and void (section 16(1)).\n\nWhen the contract relates to agricultural or forestry land and irrespective of the purchaser\u2019s nationality, the first-instance authority is the H\u00f6fekommission (\u201cFarm Commission\u201c) (section 13(1)(a)). The Farm Commission is established at the seat of the District Administration and has three members: the head of the District Administration, or a legally qualified (rechtskundig) official of that Administration appointed by him, as chairman; a person designated by the chamber of agriculture of the district; and another person, designated by the municipality in question, who is engaged in agriculture or forestry (section 9 of the Tyrolean Farms Act of 12 June 1900; Gesetz betreffend die besonderen Rechtsverh\u00e4ltnisse geschlossener H\u00f6fe). The decisions of the Farm Commission are taken by majority vote (section 13(2) of the 1970/1973 Act); they are subject to appeal to the Regional Authority (see paragraph 24 below) by, amongst others, the parties to the contract or the Transactions Officer (section 13(3)).\n\nThe Transactions Officer, who is appointed for three years by the Government of the Tyrol, must be a person who is experienced in real property transaction matters (section 14). His secretariat is provided by a division of the Office of the said Government.\n\nIf the case is referred to it, the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority established at the Office of the Land Government takes a decision as the second and final instance (section 13(4)). Its membership varies according to the subject-matter of the contract to be examined. In the case of agricultural or forestry land - whether the buyer be Austrian or foreign - its voting members are (section 13(4), no. 1): \u201c(a) a person experienced in real property transaction matters, who shall act as chairman; (b) a member of the judiciary (Richterstand); (c) a legally qualified civil servant from the Office of the Regional Government, with training in real property transaction matters, who shall act as rapporteur; (d) a senior civil servant from the Agricultural Services Department (technischer Agrardienst) of the Office of the Regional Government; (e) a senior civil servant from the Forestry Services Department (forsttechnischer Dienst); (f) an agricultural expert; (g) a lawyer (Rechtsanwalt or Notar).\u201c\n\nThe above-cited provision, which was introduced by the Act of 28 November 1973 (see paragraph 9 above), replaced a text which the Constitutional Court had held to be incompatible with Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, as interpreted by the European Court in its Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971 (Series A no. 13). The Constitutional Court had ruled that the Regional Authority, as it was constituted under the original Act of 1970, could not be considered an \u201cindependent and impartial\u201c tribunal because its members included, as chairman, one of the members of the Government of the Tyrol (section 13(1), no. 1(a), former version). Furthermore, so the Constitutional Court held, the Act did not fix the duration of the members\u2019 term of office, conferred on the said Government the power of appointing the members (save for a judge, who was appointed by the Federal Minister of Justice) and did not lay down the circumstances in which members might be removed from office (judgment of 29 June 1973, Erkenntnisse und Beschl\u00fcsse des Verfassungsgerichtshofes, 1973, vol. 38, no. 7099).\n\nFollowing this judgment, the Tyrolean legislature amended, by the same Act of 28 November 1973, the provisions in section 13 concerning, inter alia, exercise of the office of member of the Regional Authority. Sub-sections 5 to 13 of that section read as follows: \u201c(5) The member of the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority appointed from the judiciary (sub-section 4, no. 1 (b)), shall be appointed by the Federal Minister of Justice and the remaining members, by the Regional Government. For each member a substitute member shall be similarly appointed. (6) Only Austrian citizens who have reached the age of 25 years and are in full possession of their legal rights shall be eligible for appointment as members or substitute members. Persons who by reason of a criminal conviction are disqualified from jury service or from acting as lay assessors shall be ineligible. (7) Members and substitute members shall hold office for three years. Members or substitute members who are appointed within the general three-year term of office shall cease to hold office at the end of that term. Re-appointment is possible. Members and substitute members shall continue to perform their duties after expiry of their term of office until they have been replaced. (8) The quorum of the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority shall be constituted if the chairman, the member appointed from the judiciary, the rapporteur and at least two other members are present. Decisions shall be taken by majority vote. If the votes are equally divided, the chairman shall have a casting vote. Abstention shall count as a negative vote. (9) In the performance of their duties the members of the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority shall not be subject to any instructions; the executive may neither annul nor vary their decisions. (10) The details of the Real Property Transactions Authorities\u2019 procedure (such as the convening of sittings, summoning of substitute members, conduct of voting, keeping of minutes and signing of decisions) shall be laid down by the Regional Government in rules of procedure (Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung) for the said Authorities. (11) Unless they are civil servants, members of the Real Property Transactions Authorities shall receive for their work remuneration and a travel allowance, the amount of which shall be laid down in regulations made by the Regional Government. (12) A member or substitute member shall be removed from office, before the end of his term of office, if: (a) circumstances intervene which would have made him ineligible for appointment; (b) the regular performance of his duties becomes per80 manently impossible. (13) If an official of a \u201cterritorial\u201c authority (Gebietsk\u00f6rperschaft) is suspended from duty under the regulations governing his employment, he shall cease to exercise his functions as a member or substitute member of a Real Property Transactions Authority for the duration of the suspension.\u201c Sub-section (9), cited above, corresponds to Article 20 para. 2 of the Constitution, which reads: \u201cIf a Federal or a Land Act makes provision for the last-instance decision to be given by a collegiate body at least one of whose members is a judge and whose decisions cannot be annulled or varied by the executive, the other members of that body shall also not be subject to any instructions.\u201c Article 20 para. 3 of the Federal Constitution obliges the members of the Regional Authority not to disclose facts which have come to their knowledge in the exercise of their functions, if the interests of a \u201cterritorial\u201c authority or of the parties so require (Amtsverschwiegenheit).\n\nProcedure before the Real Property Transactions Authorities is governed by the General Administrative Procedure Act 1950 (Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz). The parties are entitled to consult the case-file (section 17) and must be given an opportunity of presenting their arguments (section 37). The competent authority may decide to hold a hearing (section 39(2)), which will not take place in public; the parties have the right to be heard (rechtliches Geh\u00f6r) and, inter alia, to adduce their arguments and evidence and comment on facts presented and submissions made by other persons appearing, witnesses or experts (section 43(3)). In certain circumstances which may give reason to doubt his impartiality, the civil servant concerned must arrange to be replaced (section 7).\n\nBy an order (Verordnung) of 13 September 1966, the Government of the Tyrol issued rules of procedure for the Real Property Transactions Authorities. Under Article 3 para. 1, the Authorities shall deliberate and vote in the absence of the parties, if appropriate after oral hearings. The deliberations shall be recorded in minutes to which the right to consult the case-file (Akteneinsicht), guaranteed by Article 17 of the General Administrative Procedure Act, does not extend (Article 3 para. 3). The Authorities\u2019 resolutions (Beschl\u00fcsse) must be recorded, but may be altered as long as they remain unpublished (nicht nach aussen in Erscheinung getreten) (Article 3 para. 4). Their decisions (Bescheide), which are to be reached on the basis of those resolutions (Article 4 para. 1), shall be given in writing but may in case of urgency be given orally by the chairman (Article 4 para. 2). Before the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority, the rapporteur shall, after setting out and commenting on the results of the investigation (Ermittlungsverfahren), present conclusions (Antrag); those who wish to propose alternative conclusions (Gegen- oder Ab\u00e4nderungsantr\u00e4ge) shall give reasons for them (Article 9 para. 2). The chairman shall decide the order in which voting on the conclusions is to take place (Article 9 para. 3).\n\nDecisions of a Regional Authority may be challenged before the Constitutional Court but not before the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof; Articles 133 para. 4 and 144 of the Federal Constitution). PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nIn her application of 19 September 1979 to the Commission (no. 8790/79), Mrs. Sramek alleged that she had not received a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law; she relied on Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n\nOn 4 March 1982, the Commission declared the application admissible. In its report of 8 December 1982 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion, by eleven votes to one, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the separate opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment\uf02a. FINAL SUBMISSIONS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nAt the close of the hearings on 24 January 1984, the Government requested the Court \u201cto hold that in the present case the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 6 (art. 6-1) of the Convention ... were not violated and that, as a consequence, the facts underlying the dispute do not indicate any breach by the Republic of Austria of its obligations under the Convention\u201c."}

the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Dariusz Nowak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 11 April 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 January 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. The President of the Chamber also decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the proceedings in the present case should be conducted simultaneously with those in the cases of Michalak v. Poland and Owczar v. Poland (applications nos. 16864/02 and 34117/02) (Rule 42 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Brzeg.\n\nOn 21 May 1999 the Brzeg District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) issued a \u201cwanted\u201d notice in respect of the applicant and several other men in connection with an investigation into allegations made by six women, some of whom were minors, that a group of several men had raped them, threatened them, beaten them and forced them to take drugs. The warrant for arrest was issued after the prosecution service had established that the applicant had gone into hiding and the police had unsuccessfully attempted to arrest him.\n\nOn 21 July 1999 the police attempted to arrest the applicant. However he managed to escape trying in the process to run over police officers while driving away. Two other men sought under the arrest warrant issued in connection with the same investigation were apprehended and arrested.\n\nOn 9 August 1999 the applicant was arrested by the police. At the time of arrest he was in possession of a firearm and a forged identification document. On 13 August 1999 the Opole District Court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the following offences: repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty while acting in an organised criminal gang; leading an organised gang; supplying minor victims with drugs; forging an identification document; and destroying a police car. The court also found that, given that he had absconded in the past, there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding again and try to influence the victims.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision ordering his detention on remand but his appeal was dismissed on 3 September 1999 by the Opole Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy).\n\nOn 18 October 1999 the Opole Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention relying on the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences and on the complexity of the investigation which had not yet been terminated by the prosecutor.\n\nOn 13 December 1999 the court decided that the applicant's detention should be prolonged. It considered that, in addition to the strong suspicion against the applicant, the severity of the sentence that might be imposed and the risk of his tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses justified holding him in custody. In addition, the court relied on the risk that, given that he had absconded in the past, he might go into hiding again. The court also observed that only detention on remand would secure the applicant's appearance at the trial.\n\nOn 16 December 1999 the applicant was indicted before the Opole Regional Court. It appears that the first hearing was held on 26 April 2000. In 2000 the trial court held in total 13 hearings.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant's detention was prolonged by decisions of 12 June and 13 November 2000 and 15 May 2001. The decisions were based on the reasons given for his detention on previous occasions.\n\nAfterwards, as the length of the applicant's detention had reached the statutory time\u2011limit of 2 years laid down in Article 263 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego), the Regional Court applied to the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) asking for the applicant's detention to be prolonged beyond that term. On 28 June 2001 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal allowed the application and prolonged his pre\u2011trial detention. The Court of Appeal based its decision on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed serious offences and on the risk that he might interfere with the course of justice. The court further considered that the complexity of the case constituted a special circumstance justifying his remaining in custody.\n\nOn 7 November 2001 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal again decided to prolong the pre-trial detention of the applicant, finding that the initial reasons for the detention were still valid. Furthermore, the court examined the course of the proceedings before the Opole Regional Court and agreed that the case was particularly complex and time-consuming, given the number of accused and the considerable amount of evidence which had to be examined. It considered that the trial court had acted diligently as it had taken evidence from nineteen witnesses during the last seven hearings.\n\nOn 13 February 2002 the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention until 15 May 2002. The court noted that the applicant had been detained on remand for a long time. However, it considered that the particular circumstances of the case justified keeping him in custody until 15 May 2002 by which time the trial should have been completed.\n\nNevertheless, the trial court again applied to prolong the applicant's detention. On 8 May 2002 the Court of Appeal granted the application. However, it criticised the Regional Court for the delay in the case and requested the trial court \u201cto take adequate and more intensive action to finish the trial\u201d. The court further took into account that the accused were partly responsible for the length of the proceedings because they had lodged vexatious applications for new evidence to be heard and had not complied with time-limits for filing new submissions.\n\nThe applicant's numerous applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention were to no avail.\n\nThe Opole Regional Court held 23 hearings in 2001 and 21 hearings in 2002. On 31 July 2002 the Opole Regional Court gave a judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of several counts of repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty and false imprisonment committed while acting in an organised criminal gang. The applicant was also convicted of administering an unknown psychotropic substance to some of the victims and use of a forged identity document. The court acquitted the applicant of being the leader of the organised criminal gang. The applicant was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment. The applicant and other co\u2011accused appealed.\n\nOn 2 June 2003 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal gave a judgment. It amended the first-instance judgment with respect to the applicant reducing his prison sentence to 10 years and 8 months. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy).\n\nOn 11 March 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded."}

an application (no. 4524/06) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Y\u0131lmaz Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Mr Kamiran Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Mr Mehmet Metin \u00c7\u0131lg\u0131n (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 3 January 2006.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr \u00d6. T\u00fcrkdo\u011fan, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicants alleged that there had been an interference with their right to freedom of assembly and their right to freedom of expression.\n\nOn 14 January 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants are Turkish nationals who were born in 1972, 1965 and 1961 respectively. Mr Y\u0131lmaz Y\u0131ld\u0131z lives in Ni\u011fde and the others live in Mardin.\n\nThe first applicant, Y\u0131lmaz Y\u0131ld\u0131z, is a health officer and the branch chairman of the Health and Social Services Workers\u2019 Union (Sa\u011fl\u0131k ve Sosyal Hizmet Emek\u00e7ileri Sendikas\u0131 \u2013 \u201cthe SES\u201d) in Ni\u011fde. The second applicant, Kamiran Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, is a doctor and the branch chairman of the SES in Mardin. The third applicant, Mehmet Metin \u00c7\u0131lg\u0131n, is a doctor and also a member of the SES in Mardin.\n\nOn 4 February 2005 several members of the union gathered in front of the Ni\u011fde Social Security Institution (Sosyal Sigortalar Kurumu \u2013 \u201cthe SSK\u201d) Hospital. Subsequently the first applicant read out the SES\u2019s press statement drawing attention to the problems that could arise as a consequence of the transfer of hospitals incorporated in the SSK to the Ministry of Health.\n\nThe statement read as follows: \u201cFor the attention of the press and the public: Hospitals incorporated in the SSK have been transferred to the Ministry of Health pursuant to Law no. 5283. Following that structural change patients were unable to take their medication for a long time and hospital staff have been working in a tense atmosphere. Before the structural changes our union warned the Government and the public. The probable administrative and bureaucratic problems were pointed out: SSK was going to be under a huge economic burden, people would have to pay for health care services and an additional tax was going to be imposed on workers. Our union maintains that the Government should allocate more funds from the budget to the health care services to redress the structural problems. Our union states that all citizens should be provided with equal, accessible, sufficient and free health care services.\u201d\n\nOn 25 February 2005 the second and third applicants together with another thirty persons gathered in the Mardin Yeni\u015fehir SSK Hospital yard. Subsequently, the second applicant read out the press statement in his capacity as chairman of the Mardin branch of the union.\n\nThe police did not prevent anyone from entering the yard during either gathering. Nor did they interfere with the demonstrations or the reading out of the press statements.\n\nAccording to the police reports of 4 February 2005 in Ni\u011fde and 25 February 2005 in Mardin, the two groups of demonstrators had been warned verbally that their gatherings were illegal and ordered to disband for the protection of public order and safety.\n\nThe Ni\u011fde and Mardin public prosecutors filed indictments charging the applicants with intentionally disobeying orders issued by the authorities aimed at protecting public order and safety, pursuant to section 32 of the Misdemeanours Act, Law No. 5326 (see paragraph 17 below).\n\nOn 8 June and 14 July 2005 the Mardin Magistrates\u2019 Court and the Ni\u011fde Magistrates\u2019 Court, respectively, convicted the applicants as charged and imposed on them administrative fines of 100 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 62 euros (EUR)).\n\nThe applicants appealed against the courts\u2019 decisions.\n\nOn 20 June 2005 and 26 July 2005 the Mardin Assize Court and the Ni\u011fde Assize Court, respectively, dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeals.

Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Okan Erdo\u011fan (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 20 October 2004. The applicant was represented by Mr M. N. Eldem, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 15 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1980 and lives in Kayseri, was a student at a military academy. At the time of his registration at this academy, his father had signed a promissory note for the reimbursement of the applicant\u2019s educational expenses in the event of his leaving the school, due to expulsion or otherwise.\n\nIn March 2003 the applicant was expelled from the military academy following a secret security investigation conducted by the Ministry of Defence into him and his family. The applicant was not notified of the specific reasons for his expulsion.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant asked the Supreme Military Administrative Court to annul the expulsion decision. During the proceedings, he did not have access to the classified documents and information submitted by the Ministry of Defence to the Supreme Military Administrative Court in support of its decision to expel him from the military academy.\n\nOn 10 December 2003 the Supreme Military Administrative Court refused to annul the expulsion decision. It stated that information and documents the confidentiality of which was required and necessitated for the performance of military service could not be disclosed to the applicant. The Court further emphasised that it was not bound by the classification made by the administration and that it made its own assessment as to whether the confidentiality of the documents was justified in each case. The written opinion submitted by the principal public prosecutor to the Supreme Military Administrative Court during the proceedings was not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 7 April 2004 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant\u2019s rectification request, which decision was served on the applicant on 20 April 2004.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence subsequently filed an action with the Kayseri Civil Court against the applicant for the reimbursement of his educational expenses. On 3 May 2004 the Kayseri Civil Court ordered the applicant to pay the Ministry of Defence 5,050,500,000 Turkish liras (TRL) (approximately 3,000 euros (EUR)), plus interest running from 8 April 2003.\n\nII. RELEVANT LAW\n\nA description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the decision of Karayi\u011fit v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 45874/05, 23 September 2008)."}

against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two German nationals, Mr Hans-Georg von Koester and Mr Hans-Konrad von Koester (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 8 November 2004.\n\nMr Hans-Georg von Koester is represented before the Court by the second applicant, Mr Hans-Konrad von Koester, who is a lawyer practising in Wiesbaden. The German Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicants alleged that the length of five sets of administrative proceedings and one set of official liability proceedings had been in breach of the reasonable time requirement laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 16 September 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the administrative and official liability proceedings to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1922 and 1957 respectively and live in Bonn and Wiesbaden.\n\n1. Background to the case\n\nThe first applicant was the owner of a plot of land with a landmarked house at the corner of Rheinstrasse, a main traffic artery with six lanes, and a square known as \u201cLuisenplatz\u201d in Wiesbaden. In 1983/84 that square was reshaped and an underground car park was built close to the first applicant's property. Between 1988 and 1993 several events and demonstrations took place on the square which caused noise. Furthermore several new road traffic regulations in Wiesbaden city resulted in an increased volume of traffic next to the first applicant's property. He therefore instituted several different sets of proceedings against the Wiesbaden local authorities.\n\nIn the end of 1995 the first applicant agreed before a notary to transfer the property to his son, the second applicant. In 1997 the second applicant was listed as the real estate's owner in the land register (Grundbuch). The first applicant was granted a right of enjoyment over his son's property (Nie\u00dfbrauch). The second applicant represented the first applicant throughout the proceedings before the German courts.\n\n2. Proceedings relating to noise remediation measures\n\n(a) Proceedings up to severance 8. On 29 April 1985 the second applicant asked the Wiesbaden trade supervision department (Gewerbeamt) to inform him whether there were plans to examine the influence of noise emissions on the first applicant's property. Between 1986 and 21 December 1990 the first applicant requested the Wiesbaden local authorities on several occasions to reimburse him the costs (notwendige Aufwendungen) incurred by him for noise remediation measures taken to protect him against noise caused by the construction works and, thereafter, the events and demonstrations carried out on Luisenplatz and by the increased volume of traffic. Furthermore he made official liability claims concerning his noise remediation measures and claimed damages for depreciation of his property. 9. On 2 April 1991 the first applicant lodged an action for failure to act (Unt\u00e4tigkeitsklage) with the Wiesbaden Administrative Court pursuant to section 75 of the Code of Administrative Court Procedures (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below) because the local authorities had not yet decided on his request of 21 December 1990. 10. On 4 June 1991 the Wiesbaden Administrative Court declared his action inadmissible. 11. On 14 August 1991 the first applicant appealed to the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal. 12. On 3 January 1992 he submitted a statement of grounds, which the Administrative Court of Appeal sent to the defendants on 7 January 1992. 13. On 12 July 1996 the Administrative Court of Appeal asked the parties whether they would waive an oral hearing and consent to a decision by a single judge. On 22 April 1997 and on 20 July 1997 they gave their consent. 14. On 24 February 1998 the Administrative Court of Appeal severed the official liability claims and the claim for damages in relation to the depreciation of the property and gave them a new file number (14 UE 794/98). (b) Reimbursement of costs of noise protection measures (no. 4 E 299/91) 15. By a judgment of 24 February 1998 the Administrative Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the Administrative Court of 4 June 1991 as to the reimbursement of costs for noise protection measures and referred the case to the Administrative Court for fresh consideration. 16. On 28 April 1998 the Administrative Court received the case files from the Administrative Court of Appeal. Between 14 May 1998 and 15 April 1999 it requested the first applicant on several occasions to make his submissions. 17. On 26 June 1999 the applicant informed the court that an extrajudicial settlement had been reached. On 1 September 1999 the court requested the parties to confirm that the case had been settled. After several further inquiries to the applicant as to whether the case had been settled, he made his submission on 30 March 2001. 18. On 10 December 2001 the Administrative Court held an oral hearing in which the question of the second applicant's third-party summons (Beiladung) was discussed. The sitting judge and the parties agreed that that summons was necessary. 19. On 11 December 2001 the Wiesbaden Administrative Court formally summoned the second applicant to participate in the proceedings as an interested third party. 20. By a judgment of 27 February 2002 the Administrative Court found for the applicants in part. That decision was served on the applicants on 12 and 13 March 2002. 21. On 10 April 2002 the applicants requested leave to appeal to the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal. 22. On 21 October 2002 the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal granted both applicants and the Wiesbaden local authorities leave to appeal. On 25 November 2002 the applicants submitted their statement of grounds for appeal. On 4 December 2002 the applicants received the defendant's statement of grounds together with the Administrative Court of Appeal's order to submit their reply to that statement by 6 January 2003. 23. On 20 December 2002 the applicants requested the Administrative Court of Appeal to extend the time-limit for further submissions, which it granted until 27 January 2003. The court declared that no further extensions could be granted. 24. On 26 March 2003, after holding an oral hearing on 18 March 2003, the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal quashed the Administrative Court's judgment and dismissed the action. 25. On 30 May 2003 the applicants requested leave to appeal on points of law from the Federal Administrative Court. 26. On 3 September 2003 the Federal Administrative Court refused to grant the applicants leave to appeal on points of law. 27. On 27 October 2003 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint, which the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit on 3 May 2004, without giving any reasons. 28. On 10 May 2004 that decision was served on the applicants. (c) Official liability proceedings (7 O 58/98) 29. On 26 March 1998 the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal found that the ordinary courts had been competent to decide on the compensation and official liability claims and referred them to the Wiesbaden Regional Court for adjudication. 30. Those proceedings were subsequently conducted by the Wiesbaden Regional Court under file number 7 O 58/98. 31. On 15 June 1998 the Regional Court requested the first applicant to pay the advance on the court fees which he did on 29 December 1999. 32. Between March 2000 and October 2000 the first applicant requested on several occasions extensions of the time-limits allowed for his submissions. 33. On 6 August 2001 the first applicant requested the court to stay the proceedings. 34. On 2 November 2002 he requested that a hearing scheduled by the Regional Court be postponed. 35. On 21 November 2002 the Regional Court stayed the proceedings at the first applicant's request until the termination of the administrative proceedings no. 4 E 299/91 before the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal. 36. On 10 October 2003 the Regional Court scheduled a hearing on 12 January 2004. On a request by the first applicant on 22 December 2003 the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 16 February 2004. As nobody appeared at the hearing on behalf of the applicant, the Regional Court issued a default judgment. Following an objection by the applicant the proceedings were continued. On 14 June 2004 a hearing was held during which the first applicant again requested that the proceedings be stayed on grounds of other pending administrative proceedings. 37. On 9 August 2004 the Regional Court rejected that request and scheduled a hearing on 22 November 2004. 38. On 11 April 2005 the Regional Court informed the applicants that the first applicant's numerous statements of claim (Klageantr\u00e4ge) had not been substantiated, as he had neither indicated the concrete reason nor the concrete object of his claims within the meaning of Article 253 \u00a7 2 no. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below). Accordingly, the court ordered him to formulate his statements in accordance with these formal requirements. Otherwise the court would declare them inadmissible. 39. On 23 December 2005 the first applicant submitted his statements of claim. 40. On 16 January 2006 the Regional Court held an oral hearing during which it ordered a purely written procedure after the parties had given their consent to it. The court ordered the parties to make their final submissions by 27 February 2006 and scheduled a hearing to pronounce its decision on 27 March 2006. The second applicant joined the proceedings as an interested third party. 41. On 24 March 2006 the Regional Court postponed the hearing for the pronouncement of its decision to 13 April 2006 on account of the complexity of the case. 42. On 15 May 2006 the Regional Court requested the parties to give their consent to the written procedure, as their initial consent given on 16 January 2006 had only been valid for three months (until 16 April 2006) according to section 128 \u00a7 2 sentence 3 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below). 43. On 26 July 2006 the Regional Court scheduled a hearing on 2 October 2006. 44. On 27 September 2006 the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 24 November 2006 as the applicants had not acknowledged receipt of their summons. 45. During the hearing of 24 November 2006 the defendant argued that the applicants had failed to substantiate their claims and requested to be allowed to make submissions in reply to the applicants' further submissions of 17, 23 and 24 November 2006. Therefore the court postponed the hearing to 19 January 2007 and fixed a time-limit for the defendant's submissions on 15 December 2006. 46. During the hearing held on 19 January 2007 the parties again discussed the question whether the applicant's claims had been sufficiently substantiated and the court informed the applicants that it was for them to substantiate and to prove the amount of the damages claimed. The court granted both parties the opportunity to make further submissions by 9 February 2007 and scheduled the date for the pronouncement of its judgment on 2 March 2007. Prior to the hearing the applicants made six further submissions. Therefore, the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 18 April 2007. 47. On 18 April 2007 the court again requested the parties to give their consent to the written procedure as the court was not able to decide the case within three months. 48. On 8 August 2007 the court requested the parties again to give their consent to the written procedure. As the applicants failed to respond, the court scheduled a hearing for 26 October 2007. However, on 25 October 2007 the applicants gave their consent and the court cancelled the hearing. 49. On 31 October 2007 the Regional Court authorised both parties to make further written submissions by 14 December 2007 and scheduled a hearing for the pronouncement of a decision for 18 January 2008. 50. On 18 January 2008 the court postponed the hearing to 22 February 2008 \u201cfor service-related reasons\u201d (aus dienstlichen Gr\u00fcnden). 51. On 20 February 2008 the Regional Court again requested the parties to give their consent to the written procedure, as it had overlooked that their consent of 25 October 2007 had only been valid until 25 January 2008, by which date the court would have had to pronounce its decision. Due to this procedural mistake the court cancelled the hearing scheduled on 22 February 2008 and requested the parties again to give their consent to the written procedure. After the court's further request of 31 March 2008 the applicants gave their consent on 14 April 2008. 52. On 21 April 2008 the Regional Court ordered the written procedure, granted the parties the opportunity to make submissions by 23 May 2008 and scheduled a hearing for the pronouncement of a decision on 11 July 2008. 53. On 11 July 2008 the Regional Court again informed the applicants (Hinweisbeschluss) that their statements of claim, which they had newly formulated and extended on several occasions, still failed to meet the formal requirements. It referred to its order of 11 April 2005 and concretised it by urging the applicants, inter alia, to substantiate their allegation that it was impossible for them to indicate the amount of damage caused by the alleged noise emissions. 54. That decision did not leave the Regional Court until 8 October 2008, when the court's registry provided the official copy of this decision with the court seal (Ausfertigungsvermerk). 55. On 13 March and 5 and 7 May 2009 the applicants made further submissions. 56. On 8 May 2009 the Regional Court held an oral hearing and scheduled a further hearing for the pronouncement of a judgment for 26 June 2009. 57. On 25 June and 24 July 2009 the Regional Court again postponed the hearing for the pronouncement of a judgment to 14 August 2009 on account of the complexity and difficulty of the case. 58. On 11 August 2009 the Regional Court again postponed the hearing and granted the defendant a further time-limit to make submissions by 28 August 2009. 59. These proceedings are still pending.\n\n3. Proceedings relating to various traffic regulations\n\n(a) Preliminary road closures (nos. 7 E 436/93(1) and 7 E 1208/99) i. Proceedings until severance 60. On 13 January 1992 the Wiesbaden local authorities ordered the preliminary closure of two streets, Friedrichstra\u00dfe (order no. 4/92) and Luisenstra\u00dfe (order no. 5/92). 61. On 20 February 1992 the first applicant lodged administrative appeals against both orders, and on 5 April 1993 he repeated his appeals. 62. On 28 May 1993 the first applicant lodged an action for failure to act with the Wiesbaden Administrative Court as the local authorities had not yet decided upon his administrative appeals of 20 February 1992 and 5 April 1993. 63. On 2 June 1993 the Administrative Court requested the authorities to submit their files. On 22 November 1993 it repeated its request. 64. On 6 January 1994 the defendant announced that they would submit their observations by the end of January 1994. On 11 February 1994 the court reminded the defendants to make their submissions. 65. On 22 February 1995 the Administrative Court inquired of the first applicant whether, in the light of the termination of a set of parallel pending proceedings for interim legal protection concerning the same legal issue, he wished to declare the proceedings disposed of. As the applicant failed to respond, the Administrative Court noted on 24 January 1997 that the proceedings were deemed to have been disposed of as the applicant had not pursued the proceedings for a period of more than six months. 66. On 8 April 1999 the first applicant declared that the proceedings had not entirely been disposed of. 67. On 2 September 1999 the Wiesbaden Administrative Court severed the proceedings concerning the preliminary closure of Luisenstra\u00dfe and pursued them under file number 7 E 1208/99. ii. Proceedings no. 7 E 436/93(1) 68. On 24 January 2000 the Administrative Court assigned the proceedings relating to the closure of Friedrichstra\u00dfe (file no. 7 E 436/93(1)) to a single judge. 69. On 28 January 2000 the second applicant was summoned to the proceedings as a third party. 70. On 23 February 2000 the applicants sought withdrawal of the judges of the Administrative Court sitting in their case for bias. On 20 April 2000 the applicants also sought withdrawal of the judge who was to decide on their bias challenge; the latter was rejected on 2 June 2000. 71. On 4 September 2000 the applicants were informed that the composition of the court had changed following an amendment to the courts' rules of procedure (Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung). 72. On 15 September 2000 the applicants also sought withdrawal of the new judges sitting in their case for bias. On 10 October 2000 the applicants requested an extension of the time-limit for submissions concerning the comments given by the challenged judges on their alleged bias (dienstliche Stellungnahme). On 8 November 2000 the applicants made their announced submissions. 73. On 5 and 14 February 2002 the challenged judges again commented on their alleged bias. 74. Between 28 March 2002 and 23 January 2003 the applicants repeatedly requested extensions of the time-limits allowed for making further submissions on their request for bias, which were all granted until 17 February 2003, when the applicants submitted their further reasons. 75. On 25 February 2003 the Administrative Court rejected the applicants' bias challenge of 15 September 2000 as an abuse of process. 76. The applicants' subsequent challenges for bias of 9 and 16 April 2003 were also rejected on 14 and 22 April 2003 for abuse of process. 77. By a judgment of 23 April 2003 the Administrative Court declared the action inadmissible. iii. Proceedings no. 7 E 1208/99 78. On 31 January 2000 the second applicant was summoned to the proceedings as a third party. 79. On 7 February 2002 the Administrative Court noted that the court files had been dispatched to several other chambers of the Administrative Court for consultation in connection with procedures related to objections on the grounds of bias lodged by the applicants in other proceedings. 80. On 12 December 2002 the rapporteur of the Administrative Court changed. 81. On 13 March 2003 the Administrative Court assigned the proceedings to a single judge. 82. On 9 and 16 April 2003 the applicants lodged two objections for bias, which were rejected on 14 and 22 April 2003. 83. By a judgment of 23 April 2003 the Administrative Court declared the action inadmissible. (b) Final road closures and installation of a parking meter (no. 7 E 320/99) 84. On 20 July 1994 the Wiesbaden local authorities ordered the final closure of parts of Luisenstrasse and of Friedrichstrasse to motor traffic. 85. On 12 September 1994 both applicants lodged an administrative appeal against that decision, arguing that the road closures resulted in increased traffic close to their property, which caused unbearable noise. 86. On 22 April 1998 the Wiesbaden local authorities ordered the installation of a parking meter (Parkautomat) in Luisenstrasse. 87. On 8 March 1999 the Darmstadt regional authorities dismissed an administrative appeal by the applicants against that decision by the local authorities. 88. On 12 April 1999 the applicants lodged an action with the Wiesbaden Administrative Court against the decisions of 22 April 1998 and 8 March 1999. Furthermore they lodged an action for failure to act because the local authorities had not yet decided upon their administrative appeal against the local authorities' decision of 20 July 1994. 89. On 4 February 2002 the Administrative Court noted that the court files had been dispatched to another chamber of the Administrative Court for consultation in respect of the proceedings no. 7 E 436/93. 90. On 25 February 2003 the parties were summoned to an oral hearing. 91. On 13 March 2003 the Administrative Court assigned the proceedings to a single judge. 92. On 10 and 16 April 2003 the applicants challenged the sitting judge for bias; these requests were dismissed on 14 and 22 April 2003. 93. On 23 April 2003 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicants' action. It found that the road closures had not resulted in a violation of the applicants' property rights. (c) Conversion of two streets into a pedestrian zone (no. 7 E 710/98) 94. On 7 September 1994 the Wiesbaden local authorities converted parts of Luisenstrasse and Friedrichsstrasse into a pedestrian area (Teileinziehungsverf\u00fcgungen). 95. On 12 September 1994 the first applicant lodged an administrative appeal against that decision. 96. On 13 June 1998 the first applicant lodged an action for failure to act as no decision had been taken on his administrative appeal of 12 September 1994. 97. On 7 June 1999 the second applicant was summoned to the proceedings as a third party. 98. On 4 February 2002 the rapporteur of the Administrative Court gave instructions that in the subsequent period the court file had been requested for consultation in other proceedings which the applicants were pursuing at the Administrative Court and in which decisions had to be taken regarding challenges for bias. 99. On 12 December 2002 the rapporteur of the Administrative Court changed. 100. On 25 February 2003 the parties were summoned to an oral hearing. On 13 March 2003 the Wiesbaden Administrative Court assigned the proceedings to a single judge. 101. On 9 and 16 April 2003 the applicants challenged the sitting judge for bias; these requests were dismissed on 14 and 22 April 2003. 102. On 23 April 2003 the Administrative Court dismissed the action. (d) Proceedings before the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal and before the Hessen Constitutional Court 103. On 4 June 2003 the applicants requested leave to appeal from the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal in respect of the proceedings nos. 7 E 436/93(1), 7 E 1208/99, 7 E 320/99, and 7 E 710/98. 104. On 30 January 2004 the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal refused to grant the applicants leave to appeal in respect of the proceedings no. 7 E 710/98. 105. On 2 February 2004 it refused to grant them leave to appeal concerning the proceedings nos. 7 E 436/93(1), 7 E 1208/99, 7 E 320/99. 106. On 5 March 2004 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint against the administrative courts' decisions rendered in the aforementioned proceedings with the Hessen Constitutional Court. Furthermore they accused Judge G. of that court of being biased, as he had acted as the judge in other proceedings involving the applicants at the Wiesbaden Administrative Court. 107. On 11 August 2004 the Hessen Constitutional Court dismissed their objections against Judge G. as being unfounded. 108. On 12 May 2005 the Hessen Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicants' constitutional complaint without giving any reasons. 109. On 23 May 2005 that decision was served on the applicants."}

25714/02 and 30383/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d). Application no. 74703/01 was submitted by ten applicants, namely Mr Abbas Baran, Mr Mehmet Bayram Ceylan, Mr Mehmet Cihat Ayd\u0131n, Mr M. Ali A\u011f\u0131n, Mr Mustafa Ya\u011fmur, Mr Hasan Bu\u011fa, Mr Fuat Albayrak, Mr Ahmet H\u00fcseyino\u011flu, Mr Enver Askan and Mr Hamdusela Ekinci. Application no. 74069/01 was submitted by co\u2011applicants Mr \u0130nayet \u00c7i\u00e7ek and Mr Necat \u00d6ztemel. The remainder of the applications were submitted by Mr Nusret Atl\u0131 (no. 76380/01), Mr Musa Narin (no. 16809/02), Mr \u015eaban Canpolat (no. 25710/02), Mr Mehmet Fikri Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (no. 25714/02) and Mr Mehmet Salih K\u00f6mek\u00e7i (no. 30383/02).\n\nThe applicants were all represented by Mr Sedat \u00c7\u0131nar, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn various dates between 2003 and 2005, the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants are all Turkish nationals who live in Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nIn May 1999 the applicants were laid off by the Diyarbak\u0131r Sur municipality, with which they had been employed.\n\nEach of the applicants brought an action in the Diyarbak\u0131r Labour Court, claiming outstanding salaries, dismissal indemnities, severance pays and other pecuniary rights.\n\nOn 11 November 1999 the court ruled in their favour and ordered the municipality to pay the following amounts in Turkish lira (TRL), including costs, together with interest running from June 1999: i. TRL 915,737,870 to Abbas Baran; ii. TLR 880,824,998 to Mehmet Bayram Ceylan0; iii. TLR 1,062,932,278 to M. Cihat Ayd\u0131n; iv. TLR 911,348,350 to M. Ali A\u011f\u0131n; v. TLR 1,111,150,000 to Mustafa Ya\u011fmur; vi. TLR 935,170,454 to Hasan Bu\u011fa; vii. TLR 833,474,812 to Fuat Albayrak; viii. TLR 1,078,451,254 to Ahmet H\u00fcseyino\u011flu; ix. TLR 1,021,383,958 to Enver Askan; x. TLR 905,829,494 to Hamdusela Ekinci; xi. TLR 1,000,000,000 to \u0130nayet \u00c7i\u00e7ek; xii. TRL 999,717,000 to Necat \u00d6ztemel; xiii. TRL 781,245,000 to Nusret Atl\u0131; xiv. TRL 1,111,150,000 to Musa Narin; xv. TRL 863,345,000 to \u015eaban Canpolat; xvi. TRL 27,113 to Mehmet Fikri Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m; and xvii. TRL 956,675,582 to Mehmet Salih K\u00f6mek\u00e7i.\n\nIn the absence of an appeal the judgments became final on 19 November 1999.\n\nWithin the following months, the applicants initiated enforcement proceedings in order to receive the due amounts. As their efforts proved fruitless, they requested the Diyarbak\u0131r Governorship to intervene to facilitate the enforcement of the court's judgments. The Governor's Office informed the applicants that they had requested the municipality to redress their grievances. However, the municipality did not make any payment since it was underfunded.\n\nAt the date of introduction of the current applications, the relevant judgment debts were still outstanding. However, in the meantime, friendly settlement agreements were reached between the following applicants and the municipality on the dates indicated: i. Abbas Baran on 17 January 2005; ii. Mustafa Ya\u011fmur on 25 December 2003; iii. Hasan Bu\u011fa on 28 December 2001; iv. Hamdusela Ekinci on 21 November 2005; v. \u0130nayet \u00c7i\u00e7ek on 11 December 2003; vi. Necat \u00d6ztemel on 23 December 2003; vii. Nusret Atl\u0131 on 21 November 2005; viii. Musa Narin on 20 May 2003; and ix. Mehmet Fikri Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m on 14 February 2002.\n\nNo settlement was reached with the other applicants. However, the municipality deposited certain partial amounts in the relevant account at the local enforcement office, which amounts were made available to some applicants and later paid.\n\nOn 9 November 2004 a settlement agreement was reached by the applicants' representative, Mr Sedat \u00c7\u0131nar, and the authorities. The agreement concerned the outstanding legal fees stemming from the labour courts' judgments. Mr \u00c7\u0131nar waived all of his rights and claims in connection with his representation of the applicants in the labour cases.\n\nOn 28 March 2005 Mehmet Salih K\u00f6mek\u00e7i, Ahmet H\u00fcseyino\u011flu and M. Cihat Ayd\u0131n initiated fresh claims against the municipality to recover their severance pay."}

Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr W. Ruci\u0144ski, on 6 August 2004.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 11 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Kielce.\n\nIn April 2002 the Kielce Regional Prosecutor ordered the applicant\u2019s house, car and premises used for commercial activities to be searched in view of the strong suspicion that he had been a member of a criminal group and had committed offences concerning property and documents.\n\nOn 28 May 2002 the applicant was arrested and on 29 May 2002 he was remanded in custody by the Kielce District Court on suspicion of forging documents, financial fraud and membership of a criminal gang. The court considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would tamper with evidence, given the fact that he had had close personal and business connections with several other persons charged with the same offences. On 17 June 2002 the Kielce Regional Court upheld the decision to detain him.\n\nIn decisions of 21 August and 22 November 2002 the Katowice District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention, holding that there was a contradiction between the applicant\u2019s statements and the evidence collected in the course of the proceedings. In addition, some documents had been forged and the prosecuting authorities could not yet identify all the perpetrators of the offences. The court made reference to the activities already carried out and gave a precise indication of the evidence that still had to be taken. Consequently, it decided that it was indispensable to separate the applicant from the other suspects and from the evidence which had not yet been secured. The court also relied on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the penalty he faced.\n\nOn 20 January 2003 the Kielce Regional Prosecutor extended the charges against the applicant.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was prolonged on 24 February 2003 by the Kielce District Court and subsequently by the Cracow Court of Appeal on 22 April 2003. The courts relied on the same grounds as previously invoked by the District Court. They pointed to the complexity of the case and the existence of a fear of collusion, given the applicant\u2019s role in the criminal gang and the considerable number of witnesses acquainted with the applicant who had yet to give evidence.\n\nOn 21 July 2003 a bill of indictment concerning 20 persons was filed with the Kielce District Court. The applicant was indicted on charges of multiple fraud, insurance fraud, misuse of property and membership of a criminal gang. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 254 witnesses and to obtain over 300 other pieces of evidence.\n\nOn 30 July 2003 the Kielce District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention until 30 October 2003, holding that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant and other defendants with whom he maintained close personal or business relations would tamper with evidence by inducing others to give false statements. On 28 August 2003 the Kielce Regional Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against that decision.\n\nOn 17 September and 17 November 2003 the Kielce District Court held hearings. Owing to the fact that many of the accused had entered into a plea bargain, the prosecutor filed a new bill of indictment and the hearings scheduled for 17, 18 and 19 November 2003 were adjourned until 17 December 2003 in order to give the accused the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the new bill.\n\nHearings were held on 17 December 2003, 19, 20, 21, 28 and 29 January, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 25 February, 15, 17, 22 and 24 March, 21 April, 19 May, 16 and 30 June, 14, 15, 21 (adjourned on an application by the accused) and 29 July (a hearing scheduled for 22 July was adjourned because the lawyer of one of the accused was absent), and 1, 6, 7, 8, 13 and 15 September 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, the applicant\u2019s detention was prolonged on 29 October 2003 and 28 January (an appeal by the applicant was dismissed on 11 February 2004), 24 March and 15 April 2004. The court relied on the fear of collusion stemming from the fact that many of the witnesses had not yet given evidence and that the members of the criminal group had maintained close relations. In particular, the court stressed that during the preparatory proceedings the defendants had illegally tried to contact each other. In its last decision the court also stated that the applicant and another defendant had twice lodged applications to adjourn the hearings at which it was to take evidence from the former co-accused, who possessed the greatest knowledge about the defendants\u2019 activities.\n\nOn 16 September 2004 the District Court made an application to the Cracow Court of Appeal under Article 263 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, requesting the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention beyond the statutory time-limit of 2 years. On 13 October 2004 the Court of Appeal prolonged his detention until 21 December 2004, partly allowing the application. The court stressed that the proceedings had almost been completed and that there was therefore no need to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention for the whole period requested. Its decision was upheld on 23 November 2004.\n\nA hearing scheduled for 18 October 2004 was adjourned until 19 October owing to the illness of one of the defendants. The hearing set down for 20 October 2004 had to be adjourned owing to the absence of a witness. It was held on 21 October 2004.\n\nFurther hearings were held on 10, 17 and 24 November 2004. The hearing scheduled for 29 November was adjourned at the request of one of the accused.\n\nOn 30 November 2004 the Kielce Regional Prosecutor filed another bill of indictment against the applicant and some of his co-defendants.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, the applicant lodged several unsuccessful applications for release from detention, which were dismissed on 23 July, 25 September and 31 October 2002, 17 December 2003, and 16 June and 1 September 2004.\n\nOn 8 December 2004 the Cracow Court of Appeal dismissed a second application by the District Court for the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention. The appellate court held that the District Court had failed to conclude the proceedings within the expected time-frame and that the applicant should not have to suffer the negative consequences of that fact. It further argued that the proceedings could be terminated in the course of the forthcoming hearings, given that there remained only one witness to be examined and that in the event of his absence his statements could be read out. On 15 October 2004 an appeal by the prosecutor against that decision was dismissed.\n\nHearings were held on 1, 15 and 20 December 2004.\n\nAt the hearing on 20 December 2004 the court decided to place the applicant under police supervision and to prohibit him from leaving the country.\n\nOn 28 July 2005 the Kielce District Court gave judgment, convicting the applicant and sentencing him to four years and six months\u2019 imprisonment for a total of 24 offences, most of them committed when acting within an organised criminal group."}

against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Bogus\u0142aw Kijowski (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 15 June 2007.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Z. Cicho\u0144, a lawyer practising in Krakow. The Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the domestic authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right to respect for his family life in respect of his two sons, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 12 October 2009 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 1). The President also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Krak\u00f3w.\n\nThe applicant married in 1996 and has two sons, A, born on 3 December 1996, and B, born on 4 February 2003.\n\nIn November 2002 the applicant's wife moved to her parents' house, taking A with her. One month later she instituted divorce proceedings. The applicant visited them on several occasions. However, most of these visits were disrupted by the couples' mutual hostility. In February 2003 the applicant's wife informed him that she would not allow further visits, but the applicant continued to go to her flat, sometimes with other members of his family.\n\nOn 3 August 2003 the applicant, during one of the visits, took his son A away with him, without his wife's consent and apparently by force. Afterwards A lived with the applicant in Krak\u00f3w until 8 March 2007.\n\nThe applicant submitted that A had been neglected and that he had acted in the best interests of his son. A subsequently received dental treatment, psychological support and speech therapy, and started going to school. The Government submitted that the child's psychological problems had been caused by the trauma of being kidnapped by his father, which had also led to the aggravation of his stutter. They relied on the reasoning of the Regional Court judgment of 30 June 2006 (see paragraph 16 below).\n\nIn August 2003 the applicant's wife informed the prosecutor that her son had been kidnapped by the applicant. The applicant's wife also applied to the court for sole residence of A; however, on 19 November 2003 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court decided to make a temporary residence order for A with the applicant. The applicant's wife was granted contact rights. The Government submitted that the applicant had been hindering her contact with A; the applicant denied this.\n\nIn May 2004 the parties and A were examined by experts from the RODK (Regional Family Consultation Centre). Their opinion was that A should live with his mother, although the applicant should enjoy extensive contact rights.\n\nOn 22 November 2004 the court changed its decision of 19 November 2003 and made a residence order for A with the applicant's wife. The applicant was granted contact rights and was ordered to return the child to his wife. An appeal by the applicant against this decision was dismissed on 22 March 2005.\n\nThe applicant failed to comply with this decision and refused to return A.\n\nOn 8 December 2004 the Brzesko District Court dismissed in the light of DNA tests the applicant's action contesting his paternity of B. Subsequently, the applicant attempted to visit B; however, his wife apparently hindered his contact with his younger son.\n\nThe applicant continued to live with A, who changed schools; they apparently moved house more than once. The applicant's wife complained to the prosecutor and attempted to have the decision of 22 November 2004 enforced.\n\nOn 30 June 2006 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court granted the applicant's petition for divorce. The court further decided to limit the applicant's parental responsibility for A and to deprive him altogether of parental responsibility for B. Residence of both children was ordered to be with the applicant's former wife. The court also allowed the applicant contact rights in respect of both his sons.\n\nAn appeal by the applicant against the judgment was dismissed on 28 December 2006 by the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal. The reasoned judgment was notified to the applicant on 15 February 2007.\n\nThe applicant's former wife made contact with B impossible for the applicant. However, he failed to institute enforcement proceedings against his former wife or to apply to the court for a fine to be imposed on her.\n\nOn 8 March 2007 the applicant was arrested by the police in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had kidnapped A and kept him, in spite of the final judgment of 30 June 2006 and the previous order of 22 November 2004. He remained in pre-trial detention for six months and was released in September 2007. On 25 May 2007 the applicant was indicted before the Krak\u00f3w District Court. Subsequently, the applicant and his mother were found guilty of keeping A with them, in breach of domestic decisions. On 4 December 2009 the Krakow Regional Court quashed that judgment. It appears that the proceedings are pending before the trial court.\n\nA was only returned to residence with his mother three months after the applicant's arrest, because between 8 March and 8 July 2007 he had been living with the applicant's mother.\n\nOn 25 January 2008 A was heard by the prosecutor in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The child stated that he preferred to live with his father and that his mother had been threatening him and had forbidden him to call his father.\n\nIn March 2008 A ran away from his mother's and went to his father's house, located 100 kilometres away. The applicant took him to the police station and A was returned to his mother.\n\nOn 1 April 2008 A ran away again and joined his father in Krak\u00f3w. They have been living together since then.\n\nOn 8 April 2008 the applicant applied to the D\u0105browa Tarnowska District Court for a new decision regarding parental responsibility and for an order for A's residence with him.\n\nOn 10 April 2008 the court guardian visited the applicant and A. According to her opinion, A did not want to live with his mother, had good living conditions with his father and paternal grandmother in Krak\u00f3w and preferred to stay with his father.\n\nOn 14 April 2008 the court dismissed the applicant's request for an interim order changing the child's place of residence (o zabezpieczenie wniosku).\n\nOn 23 June 2008 the Tarnow Regional Court made an interim order suspending contact between the applicant and B, which had been ordered in the divorce judgment of 30 June 2006.\n\nAt a hearing on 6 October 2008 the D\u0105browa Tarnowska District Court heard, inter alia, the director of A's former school, which he had been attending while living at his mother's. She testified that A had very often spoken to her complaining about his situation at home, in particular that his mother had prohibited him from visiting his father as well as from calling the applicant or using a computer for the purpose of contacting him. During the stay at his mother's the child apparently felt that he had been treated differently from his brother B and that his mother had threatened that he would be taken to a children's home and that his father would be arrested again.\n\nOn 6 October 2008 the court again dismissed the applicant's request for an interim order allowing A's place of residence to be with him. The court established that A had had de facto residence with the applicant between August 2003 and March 2007 and since April 2008. The child obviously had a stronger attachment to his father. However, the court did not consider that there was enough evidence to issue an interim order changing the earlier decision of A's place of residence before the case was ready for a decision on the merits.\n\nAt the hearing on 27 April 2009 the court heard A, who was then twelve years old, for the first time.\n\nOn the same date the court dismissed the applicant's request for the interim residence of A to be with him. The court again considered that without a thorough examination of the case it would not be possible to assess whether the best interests of the child required him to stay with his mother or with his father. Therefore the court decided to first hear experts and to obtain their opinion in order to establish the reasons for A's hostility towards his mother. An appeal by the applicant against this decision was dismissed on 20 July 2009.\n\nOn 11 August 2009 the D\u0105browa Gornicza District Court ordered an opinion to be prepared by the RODK. The opinion was finally submitted to the court on 16 December 2009. According to the experts the best interests of A required that the residence order be changed to allow A to live with the applicant. The experts took into account the feelings and choices made by A and the family situation characterised by a prolonged conflict between his parents, with A caught in the middle of that conflict. Nevertheless the experts noticed that A had been influenced by the applicant, who had enlisted him in a coalition against his mother and expected absolute loyalty from him. Such behaviour worked against the applicant's ability to be a good parent and violated the child's right to express his feelings freely and to form views about the family and the world on the basis of his own experience.\n\nOn 15 February 2010 the Krak\u00f3w District Court allowed the applicant's request of 8 April 2008, granted him full parental responsibility and ordered A's residence with him. It limited the parental responsibility of the applicant's former wife in respect of A. The court considered that A's negative attitude towards his mother, which manifested itself during the period when he was under her care in 2007, had been caused by the lengthy period of total deprivation of any contact between them and during which the applicant had isolated A from his mother. Moreover, for a prolonged period of time the applicant had the undisturbed opportunity to influence his child and create a very strong bond between them. Nevertheless, the court considered that the situation of the child had substantially changed since the divorce judgment of 30 June 2006. A had been living with the applicant, who has been securing his emotional and material needs. The court also took into account the wish of the child as to his preferred place of residence, given his age and level of maturity. Regard being had to the above, the court decided that the best interests of the child required the previous decisions to be modified and an order made for A's place of residence to be with the applicant.\n\nThe applicant's former wife appealed against the decision, but on 15 July 2010 the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court dismissed the appeal.\n\nOn 7 April 2010 the D\u0105browa Tarnowska District Court modified the judgment of 30 June 2006 and banned any contact between the applicant and his younger son B. The court found that the applicant had never wanted his second child, contested his paternity of him and had seen B only twice: once after B's birth in 2003 and once in connection with the preparation of a psychological opinion at the RODK. In consequence B, seven years old, had not developed any emotional ties with the applicant, and in fact was afraid of him and perceived him as a threat to the stability of his family. The court concluded that the best interests of the child required all contact between him and the applicant to cease.\n\nThe applicant appealed against this decision, but on 11 June 2010 the Dabrowa Tarnowska District Court rejected the appeal for failure to lodge it in accordance with formal requirements, namely by lodging it out of time. A further appeal against the latter decision was dismissed on 20 July 2010 by the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court."}

the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a German national, Mr J\u00fcrgen Schneider (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 June 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr J. Postlmayr, a lawyer practising in Mattighofen. The Austrian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The German Government did not make use of their right to intervene under Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn 7 November 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Stephanskirchen.\n\nOn 25 March 2000 the applicant, driving on the A1 motorway in the direction of Linz, was stopped by a traffic patrol. The officers noted that he had been driving at 200 km/h, thus exceeding the speed limit of 130 km/h by 70 km/h, and that he had kept driving in the left-hand lane, in breach of the Road Traffic Act. Furthermore, they observed that, despite the good visibility, the applicant had switched on his fog-lights, and that he had failed to present his driving licence when they had requested him to do so.\n\nSubsequently, on 27 April 2000 the Amstetten District Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) requested the applicant to comment on the above charges.\n\nOn 15 May 2000 the applicant filed his defence. He stated that he had been in a rush, since his passenger was sick and he wanted to take him home as fast as possible. Furthermore, he claimed that he had been driving at a maximum of 160 km/h. In addition, he submitted that he had been constantly overtaking cars, which was why he had been driving in the left-hand lane. The applicant contended that he had not used any fog-lights.\n\nIn a decision of 5 October 2000 the Amstetten District Authority convicted the applicant of four traffic offences, namely speeding, breaching the requirement to drive in the right-hand lane, unjustified use of fog-lights and failure to carry his driving licence with him, and imposed fines amounting in total to 7,000 Austrian schillings (508.71 euros) on him, with 236 hours\u2019 imprisonment in default. Moreover, it ordered him to pay procedural costs.\n\nRepeating his defence, the applicant, on 2 November 2000, lodged an appeal as regards the first three offences with the Lower Austria Independent Administrative Panel (Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat). He did not appeal against his conviction for failure to carry a driving licence with him. He did not request a hearing.\n\nOn 28 May 2001 the Independent Administrative Panel, sitting in camera, dismissed the appeal. It stated that two police officers had been following the applicant over a stretch of more than 1,000 metres and had made consistent statements on the event.\n\nOn 24 July 2001 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). He alleged in particular that the Independent Administrative Panel had failed to hold a hearing. This would have allowed it to examine his passenger and the police officers and, if need be, to obtain an expert opinion. Furthermore he repeated his defence as regards the charges of speeding and driving in the left-hand lane. As to the alleged use of fog-lights, the applicant presumed that they had possibly been mixed up with his xenon lamps.\n\nAt the Administrative Court\u2019s request, the applicant submitted a second copy of his complaint on 14 August 2001.\n\nOn 20 November 2001 the Independent Administrative Panel filed its observations on the case. It stated that the applicant had failed to request a hearing. Nor had he applied for the examination of a witness or the production of an expert opinion.\n\nOn 16 January 2002, the applicant supplemented his complaint. He asserted, in particular, that an oral hearing had to be held even if he had not expressly requested one.\n\nIn an order of 29 January 2002 the Independent Administrative Panel was requested to submit the file. On 27 February 2002 it informed the Administrative Court that the file was missing. At the same time it submitted a statement in reply. The applicant made further submissions on 19 March 2002.\n\nOn 23 July 2004 the Administrative Court partly quashed the Independent Administrative Panel\u2019s decision. It (a) upheld the conviction as regards speeding but quashed the sentence relating to this offence; (b) quashed the conviction and sentence as to the unjustified use of broad-beam lamps; and (c) refused to deal with the complaint relating to the conviction for breaching the requirement to drive in the right-hand lane pursuant to section 33a of the Administrative Court Act. In respect of the first two offences the Administrative Court remitted the case to the Independent Administrative Panel, holding that the latter was obliged to hold a hearing, since none of the exceptions set out in section 51e of the Administrative Offences Act (Verwaltungsstrafgesetz), which regulates the question of oral hearings, had been present. The Administrative Court\u2019s judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 24 August 2004.\n\nOn 7 September 2004 the Independent Administrative Panel issued a summons for a hearing on 30 September 2004.\n\nOn that date the Independent Administrative Panel heard the two police officers as witnesses. The applicant had asked to be excused.\n\nOn 3 November 2004, following a further excuse by the applicant\u2019s counsel, the Independent Administrative Panel scheduled another hearing for 29 November 2004.\n\nIn a letter of 26 November 2004 counsel notified the Independent Administrative Panel that, since he was unable to contact the applicant, neither he nor his client would attend the hearing. The hearing was held on 29 November 2004 in the absence of the defence.\n\nOn 13 December 2004 the Independent Administrative Panel dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The decision was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 30 December 2004.\n\nThe applicant did not lodge a complaint with the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court."}

case originated in two applications (nos. 16231/06 and 4890/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Hakan Y\u0131lmaz and Mr Taner Zabun (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 3 April 2006 and 15 January 2008, respectively.\n\nThe first applicant was represented by Mr H. \u0130\u015fler, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The second applicant was represented by Mr A. Okat, a lawyer practising in K\u00fctahya. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 May 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nThe applicants were born in 1980 and 1975, respectively, and live in Ankara and K\u00fctahya.\n\nThe first applicant lost the sight of his right eye and the second applicant was injured in the legs during their compulsory military service. Upon the refusal of the Retirement Fund (Emekli Sand\u0131\u011f\u0131) to grant them special disability benefits, they applied to the Supreme Military Administrative Court, separately, for annulment of the Retirement Fund's decisions.\n\nOn 6 October 2005 and 5 April 2007, respectively, the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected their requests. In delivering its decision in respect of the first applicant, the Supreme Military Administrative Court relied on an old expert report which it had obtained during an action for damages filed previously by the applicant regarding the same disability. The written opinions submitted by the principal public prosecutor to the Supreme Military Administrative Court regarding their cases were not communicated to the applicants.\n\nThe applicants' requests for rectification were rejected by the Supreme Military Administrative Court on 15 December 2005 and 5 July 2007, respectively. The decision of 5 July 2007 was served on the second applicant on 17 July 2007."}

The applicants\u2019 application to the Court referred to Article 48 as amended by Protocol No. 90, which Austria had ratified. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 4 thereof read in conjunction with Rule 100 \u00a7 1 and Rule 24 \u00a7 6 of the Rules of Court, a Panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 14 January 1999 that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Third Section. The Chamber ultimately constituted within the Section included Mr. J.-P. Costa, Mr P. K\u016bris, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr K. Jungwiert, Mrs H.S. Greve and Mr K. Traja.\n\nOn 12 March 1999 the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues of the case. By letter of 29 April 1999 the applicants informed the Court that they did not wish to submit a memorial; on 17 May 1999 the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of the case.\n\nAfter consulting the Agent of the Government and applicants\u2019 lawyer the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing in the case.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants' farm was the object of land consolidation proceedings (Zusammenlegungsverfahren) instituted by the Gmunden District Agricultural Authority (Agrarbezirksbeh\u00f6rde) on 22 February 1973.\n\nOn 21 August 1984 the District Authority held a hearing at which the farmers concerned could express their wishes (Wunschverhandlung) and on 22 August 1985 the District Authority ordered the provisional transfer of the properties concerned, inter alia, land owned by the applicants. In July 1989 the District Authority issued a consolidation plan (Zusammenlegungsplan). The applicants appealed, claiming that they had not received adequate land in exchange for their parcels AK 2 and AK 8. On 5 July 1990 the Upper Austria Regional Land Reform Board (Landesagrarsenat) dismissed the applicants' appeal after an oral hearing held in private, but in the presence of the parties and their lawyer.\n\nOn 25 September 1990 the applicants filed a complaint with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) against the above decision. They also asked the Court to hold an oral hearing.\n\nOn 15 December 1992 the Administrative Court dismissed the complaint, rejecting at the same time, in accordance with Section 39 (2) no. 6 of the Administrative Court Act, the applicants' request for an oral hearing."}

application (no. 16637/07) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Ms Aysel Aydin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 April 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. Hilbrans, a lawyer practising in Berlin. The German Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that her criminal conviction violated her right to freedom of expression.\n\nOn 30 November 2009 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1). Having been informed of the case by a letter of 3 December 2010, the Turkish Government did not express any wish to intervene under Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Wuppertal. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\n1. Background to the case\n\nOn 22 November 1993 the German Interior Ministry issued a decision by which it imposed a ban on the activities of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (\u201cthe PKK\u201d), under Article 18, second sentence, of the Law on Associations (Vereinsgesetz, see Relevant domestic law, below).\n\nRelevant parts of the decision read as follows: \u201c1. The activities pursued by the \u201cWorkers' Party of Kurdistan\u201d (PKK)...run contrary to provisions of the criminal law, are directed against the concept of international understanding, endanger inner security and other important interests of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe \u201cWorkers' Party of Kurdistan\u201d (PKK)...is not allowed to pursue its activities within the territorial ambit of the Law on Associations.\u201d\n\nAs the PKK as such did not challenge the imposition of the ban before the German courts, the decision became final on 26 March 1994.\n\nFollowing the arrest of its leader, Abdullah \u00d6calan, in 1999, the PKK's executives changed their strategy and declared an end to the armed battle against Turkish army entities. Following a \u201cpeace initiative\u201d declared by the party's seventh congress on 17 January 2000, the PKK did not organise any further demonstrations or violent acts in Germany.\n\nIn 2001 the PKK's presidential counsel decided to launch a large-scale campaign, during which their supporters should address themselves to the German authorities, should acknowledge their support for the PKK and should demand that the ban on the PKK's activities be lifted.\n\nThe supporters signed a declaration. The declarations were then collected and handed over in large numbers to parliaments, administrative bodies and courts. The content of the largely identical declarations was as follows: \u201cSelf declaration (Selbsterkl\u00e4rung) \u201cI also am a follower of the PKK\u201d (\u201cAuch ich bin ein PKK'ler\u201d) As the Kurdish people has been denied its basic right to life, it has had no choice but to take up arms. After twenty years of war, our national leader, Abdullah \u00d6calan, has initiated a strategic change. For two years the PKK has been using exclusively political means to fight for a peaceful and democratic solution to the Kurdish question. On the basis of this new strategy the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK) is undergoing a global reformation. Strongly determined to find a solution, it has developed its political activities against all resistance without leaving the framework of legality. Although the Kurdish question emerged geographically in the Middle East, having regard to its historical, political and international connections it is a European problem waiting for a solution. Europe played a major role in the setting of Middle Eastern boundaries. That is why Europe is now confronted with the task of playing a role in the solution of the problems. Just as it failed to offer a prospect of a solution when our leader was abducted in the framework of an international conspiracy, Europe fails today to make use of the opportunities offered by the PKK. While the majority of the European Member States make Turkey's accession to the European Union dependent on the Copenhagen criteria, they deny the national and political status of the Kurds living in Europe. Germany and England, in particular, insist on a policy of bans. With this destructive attitude Europe puts itself within the context of the policy of destruction and negation which is directed against the Kurdish people. Today as in the past Europe continues its negative tradition. This is nothing but a policy of double moral standards.\n\nOn this basis I, as a member of the Kurdish people, declare that I share the PKK's new policy, which, for two years, has been leading its political fight on a legal basis. I further declare that I belong to the PKK.\n\nI challenge the European Member States to apply the same standards to themselves they apply to non-member States. I furthermore request these States to comply themselves with the express criteria for accession to the European Union with regard to the Kurds living in Europe. I therefore demand the full recognition of the rights granted to other peoples for the Kurdish people.\n\nI further demand the official recognition of the cultural and political values created by the Kurdish people in the course of their great struggle. In this context I demand respect for my people's national and political identity.\n\nI support the line of the PKK's democratic struggle, as has been confirmed by its seventh congress. Having regard to the fact that the PKK has not committed one single violent act for two years, I demand the lifting of all bans which are applied on the PKK.\n\nI further declare that the liberty of our leader, Abdullah \u00d6calan, and the possibility of his political activity are the only guarantee for an enduring solution. I therefore demand: \u201cFreedom for Abdullah \u00d6calan \u2013 Peace in Kurdistan\u201d. I hereby declare that I most severely condemn the prohibition issued against the PKK and the criminal prosecution of PKK membership and of active sympathy for the PKK. I further declare that I do not acknowledge this prohibition and that I assume all responsibility arising therefrom.\u201d\n\n2. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nWith others, the applicant organised and coordinated a collection of signatures of the declaration in Berlin. She also signed a declaration herself. On 16 July 2001 the applicant, with two others, handed two folders containing 467 signed declarations to the Berlin public prosecutor. On 24 September 2001 the applicant handed over one further folder containing declarations. Furthermore, the applicant donated certain sums of money to a sub-organisation of the PKK, which was also subject to the ban.\n\nWithin the framework of the campaign, more than 4,000 declarations were handed to the authorities in Berlin; approximately 100,000 declarations were submitted to German administration as a whole.\n\nOn 17 July 2003 the Berlin Regional Court (Landgericht) convicted the applicant of contravening a ban imposed on an association's activity (section 20 \u00a7 1 no. 4 in conjunction with section 18, second sentence, of the Law on Associations) and sentenced her to 150 daily fines of eight euros each. During the hearing before that court, the applicant submitted a declaration that she had not intended to breach the criminal law, but to express her opinion and to further the understanding between the German and the Kurdish people. The Regional Court considered that the applicant, by signing the declaration, taking part in the campaign and giving donations, had flouted the ban on pursuing the PKK's activities.\n\nThe Regional Court considered that the declaration's content, seen in the context of the accompanying campaign, was likely to have a positive effect on the association's unlawful activities. The Regional Court considered, in particular, that the declaration \u201cnot (to) acknowledge this ban and (to) assume all responsibility arising therefrom\u201d had a twofold effect: Firstly, the applicant expressed her commitment not to abide by the ban in the future and thus to provide the PKK with security for planning further unlawful activities. Secondly, it was likely to strengthen solidarity with other potential supporters.\n\nAccording to the Regional Court, the declaration signed by the applicant was not covered by her right to freedom of expression, as the applicant did not confine herself to claiming freedom and self-determination for the Kurdish people, to demand the lifting of the ban on the PKK and most severely to condemn its continuation, which would fall within the ambit of the applicant's freedom of expression. Seen in the context of the aims of the overall campaign, the declaration also contained the statement that the applicant would continue to support the PKK even if the ban imposed on its activities was not lifted. This was already implied in the concluding statement, that the applicant would \u201cassume all responsibility arising therefrom\u201d, that is to say from any flouting of the ban. The Regional Court also considered that the campaign had the further aim of overburdening the public prosecution service with such a large number of criminal proceedings that they would not be able to cope.\n\nThe Regional Court considered as mitigating factors, inter alia, the importance of the right to freedom of expression.\n\nOn 15 January 2004 the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), referring to its own pilot judgment given on 27 March 2003 (see relevant domestic law and practice, below), dismissed the applicant's appeal on points of law. According to that court, the Regional Court's interpretation of the applicant's statement and the evaluation of her behaviour were compatible with the right to freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 5 of the Basic Law. Having regard to the context and the circumstances of the case, the Regional Court had comprehensively and coherently refuted the applicant's allegations that she had not participated in a campaign which had been organised by the PKK with the aim to hamper the criminal prosecution of breaches of the ban by provoking a massive quantity of criminal investigations, but that she had merely intended to express her opinion on the ban. This was demonstrated by the fact that the applicant and the other campaigners did not address themselves to the Federal Interior Ministry, which would have been competent for lifting the ban, but addressed a massive quantity of collected individually signed declarations to the public prosecutor's office. The applicant's unwillingness to abide by the ban was further demonstrated by the fact that she had been previously convicted of a similar offence and that she had flouted the ban in another, separate way by financially supporting a sub-organisation of the PKK.\n\nThe Federal Court of Justice finally considered that the Regional Court had sufficiently weighted the importance of the right to freedom of expression when assessing the sentence.\n\nOn 20 March 2004 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which she complained that her right to freedom of expression and her right to petition had been violated.\n\nOn 26 September 2006 the Federal Constitutional (Bundesverfassungsgericht), in a reasoned decision of 21 pages, refused to accept the applicant's complaint for adjudication as being unfounded.\n\nThe Federal Constitutional Court held that the applicant's statements fell within the ambit of her right to freedom of expression under Article 5 of the Basic Law. It considered, however, that her conviction was justified under paragraph 2 of that same Article as being based on a general law. The Federal Constitutional Court considered, at the outset, that the activities of an association could only be banned if it generally and continuously pursued dangerous aims, which was established by the enforceable ban issued by the Interior Ministry. Section 20 \u00a7 1 no. 4 of the Law on Association was not directed against the expression of an opinion as such, but only against the purposeful support it lent to the association's activity which had been prohibited in the interest of protecting the democratic state based on the rule of law. An individual person who pursued his own political aims was not concerned; he was merely prevented from doing so by supporting the activities of a prohibited association.\n\nIt followed that only such behaviour was subject to criminal liability, which was relevant with regard to the purpose of the banning order. Furthermore, the behaviour had to be related to the association's activity. Art. 5 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law had not to cede already where someone advocated the same opinions as the organisation affected by the ban; it did have to cede, however, if an unbiased observer gained the impression that this was an action which was directly related to the association. The necessary relation to the purpose of the banning order was lacking where statements of opinions worked towards a lift of a ban of activities, which was protected by the right to freedom of expression in the interest of the openness of the democratic process.\n\nIn the context of the criminal courts' examination of whether the constituent elements of an offence exist, freedom of opinion took second place without a weighing being required in the individual case, notwithstanding individual weighing that was necessary on other levels, for instance as regarded the fixing of the fine. The only decisive question was whether the above-mentioned criteria had been met.\n\nWith regard to the application of these principles in the instant case, the Federal Constitutional Court found as follows: (a) The courts answered the question of whether the self-declarations bore sufficient relation to the association's activity in the affirmative. According to the facts established by the lower courts, which are constitutionally unobjectionable, the declarations were made in the context of a mass campaign initiated and steered by the PKK leadership, which was carried out Germany-wide and attracted considerable public attention. The campaign was preceded by large-scale advertising, the content of the declaration was discussed among Kurdish compatriots, and the letters were collected and submitted, sometimes in the course of demonstrations. The headline and the text of the declaration itself (\u201cI am also a follower of the PKK\u201d, \u201cI further declare that I belong to the PKK\u201d) also made it possible for the courts to infer, in a constitutionally unobjectionable manner, a sufficient relation precisely to the PKK as the organisation affected from the ban on activities. (b) The courts observed the principles established by the Federal Court of Justice in its judgment dated 27 March 2003, that the self declarations would nevertheless have been exempt from criminal liability as expressions of the right to freedom of expression if they had restricted themselves to demanding freedom and self-determination for the Kurdish people, to calling for a lift of the ban on the PKK's activities and severely condemning the maintenance of that ban. The right to freedom of expression includes the right to assert one's opinion as effectively as possible. The effect of a strengthening of solidarity that goes along with a support of the lift of the ban is to be tolerated in the interest of the free expression of opinion even if it is at the same time an expression of sympathy for the banned association. The courts, however, assumed in a constitutionally unobjectionable manner that the self-declarations in favour of the PKK transgressed the boundaries, thus determined, of declarations of solidarity and sympathy in favour of an association affected by a ban on activities to the extent that they had to be understood as a commitment made by those signing it not to respect the ban on activities in the future and not to be deterred from contravening the ban even by the threat of criminal sanctions. The courts could assume without misjudging freedom of opinion that such a declaration of willingness to break the law that was made in the context of a mass campaign complied with the constituent element of the offence in question.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Constitutional Court further considered that the criminal conviction did not violate the applicant's right to petition as enshrined in the Basic Law.\n\nThis decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 16 October 2006."}

European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ali B\u00fclent Sar\u0131ta\u00e7 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 21 November 1995.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs Semra Dural Esim, a lawyer practising in Mu\u011fla (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr R\u0131za T\u00fcrmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaint (applications nos. 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32964/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 \u00a7 2).\n\nBy a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties\u2019 observations, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1)\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Arrest and detention of the applicant\n\nOn 15 June 1979 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the THKP-C (Turkish People\u2019s Liberation Party/Front).\n\nOn 11 July 1979 the applicant was detained on remand.\n\nB. Trial in the Istanbul Martial Law Court\n\nOn 15 January 1980 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant and 127 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation, namely the THKP/C, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. He further charged the applicant with having been involved in a number of crimes such as armed robbery of public and private properties, and opening fire on several individuals.\n\nThe prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 30 July and 17 October 1980, 24 March 1981 and 23 February 1982 in respect of additional criminal proceedings initiated against the applicant before the Zonguldak, Torba and Izmir Assize Courts (a\u011f\u0131r ceza mahkemesi), the courts issued decisions of non\u2011jurisdiction on the ground that the incidents fell within the jurisdiction of the Martial Courts. The cases were joined to the case-file before the \u0130stanbul Martial Court.\n\nIn a judgment of 8 November 1984 the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the THKP/C and his involvement in the alleged crimes. It sentenced the applicant to death penalty under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.\n\nC. Proceedings on appeal\n\nAs the applicant\u2019s sentence exceeded 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, his case was automatically referred to the Military Court of Cassation (Askeri Yarg\u0131tay).\n\nOn 12 April 1988 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court failed to establish the applicant\u2019s involvement in some of the alleged crimes. It referred the case to the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court.\n\nOn 17 August 1990 the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment, permanently debarred him from employment in the civil service and placed him under judicial guardianship. The applicant appealed.\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (Yarg\u0131tay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 4 January 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.\n\nOn 18 April 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction."}

Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter called \u201cthe Government\u201c). The case has its origin in an application against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (hereinafter called \u201cthe Commission\u201c) under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Convention\u201c), by a United Kingdom citizen, Mr. Sidney Elmer Golder. The application was first submitted in 1969; it was supplemented in April 1970 and registered under no. 4451/70. The Commission\u2019s report in the case, drawn up in accordance with Article 31 (art. 31) of the Convention, was transmitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 5 July 1973.\n\nThe Government\u2019s application, which was made under Article 48 (art. 48) of the Convention, was lodged with the registry of the Court on 27 September 1973 within the period of three months laid down in Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47). The purpose of the application is to submit the case for judgment by the Court. The Government therein express their disagreement with the opinion stated by the Commission in their report and with the Commission\u2019s approach to the interpretation of the Convention.\n\nOn 4 October 1973, the Registrar received from the Secretary of the Commission twenty-five copies of their report.\n\nOn 9 October 1973, the then President of the Court drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of five of the seven judges called upon to sit as members of the Chamber, Sir Humphrey Waldock, the elected judge of British nationality, and Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri, Vice-President of the Court, being ex officio members under Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 3 (b) of the Rules of Court respectively. The five judges chosen were MM. R. Cassin, R. Rodenbourg, A. Favre, T. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson and W. Ganshof van der Meersch, (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). The President also drew by lot the names of substitute judges (Rule 2l para. 4). Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri assumed the office of President of the Chamber in accordance with Rule 21 para. 5.\n\nThe President of the Chamber ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and of the Delegates of the Commission on the procedure to be followed. By Order of 12 October 1973, he decided that the Government should file a memorial within a time-limit expiring on 3l January 1974 and that the Delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of the receipt of the Government\u2019s memorial. The President of the Chamber also instructed the Registrar to request the Delegates to communicate to the Court the main documents listed in the report. These documents were received at the registry on 17 October. The President later granted extensions of the times allowed, until 6 March 1974 for the Agent of the Government, and until 6 June and then 26 July for the Delegates (Orders of 21 January, 9 April and 5 June 1974). The Government\u2019s memorial was received at the registry on 6 March 1974 and that of the Commission - with observations by the applicant\u2019s counsel annexed - on 26 July.\n\nThe Chamber met in private on 7 May 1974. Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, who had been elected a member of the Court in January 1974 in place of Sir Humphrey Waldock, took his seat in the Court as the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 2 para. 3) (art. 43). On the same day the Chamber, \u201cconsidering that the case raise(d) serious questions affecting the interpretation of the Convention\u201c, decided under Rule 48 to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court. The new President of the Court, Mr. Balladore Pallieri, assumed the office of President.\n\nAfter consulting the Agent of the Government and the Delegates of the Commission, the President decided, by Order of 6 August 1974, that the oral hearings should open on 11 October.\n\nThe public hearings took place on 11 and 12 October 1974 in the Human Rights Building at Strasbourg. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government: Mr. P. Fifoot, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Barrister-at-Law, Agent and Counsel, Sir Francis Vallat, K.C.M.G., Q.C., Professor of International Law, King\u2019s College, London; formerly Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, Mr. G. Slynn, Q.C., Recorder of Hereford, Counsel, and Sir William Dale, K.C.M.G., formerly Legal Adviser to the Commonwealth Office, Mr. R. M. Morris, Principal, Home Office, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission: Mr. G. Sperduti, Principal Delegate, MM. T. Opsahl and K. Mangan, Delegates, and Mr. N. Tapp, Q.C., who had represented the applicant before the Commission, assisting the Delegates under Rule 29 para. 1, second sentence. The Court heard the addresses and submissions of Mr. Fifoot, Sir Francis Vallat and Mr. Slynn for the Government and of Mr. Sperduti, Mr. Opsahl and Mr. Tapp for the Commission, as well as their replies to questions put by the Court and by several judges. At the hearings, the Government produced certain documents to the Court\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nThe facts of the case may be summarised as follows.\n\nIn 1965, Mr. Sidney Elmer Golder, a United Kingdom citizen born in 1923, was convicted in the United Kingdom of robbery with violence and was sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. In 1969, Golder was serving his sentence in Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight.\n\nOn the evening of 24 October 1969, a serious disturbance occurred in a recreation area of the prison where Golder happened to be. On 25 October, a prison officer, Mr. Laird, who had taken part and been injured in quelling the disturbance, made a statement identifying his assailants, in the course of which he declared: \u201cFrazer was screaming ... and Frape, Noonan and another prisoner whom I know by sight, I think his name is Golder ... were swinging vicious blows at me.\u201c\n\nOn 26 October Golder, together with other prisoners suspected of having participated in the disturbance, was segregated from the main body of prisoners. On 28 and 30 October, Golder was interviewed by police officers. At the second of these interviews he was informed that it had been alleged that he had assaulted a prison officer; he was warned that \u201cthe facts would be reported in order that consideration could be given whether or not he would be prosecuted for assaulting a prison officer causing bodily harm\u201c.\n\nGolder wrote to his Member of Parliament on 25 October and 1 November, and to a Chief Constable on 4 November 1969, about the disturbance of 24 October and the ensuing hardships it had entailed for him; the prison governor stopped these letters since Golder had failed to raise the subject-matter thereof through the authorised channels beforehand.\n\nIn a second statement, made on 5 November 1969, Laird qualified as follows what he had said earlier: \u201cWhen I mentioned the prisoner Golder, I said \u2018I think it was Golder\u2019, who was present with Frazer, Frape and Noonan, when the three latter were attacking me. \u201cIf it was Golder and I certainly remember seeing him in the immediate group who were screaming abuse and generally making a nuisance of themselves, I am not certain that he made an attack on me. \u201cLater when Noonan and Frape grabbed me, Frazer was also present but I cannot remember who the other inmate was, but there were several there one of whom stood out in particular but I cannot put a name to him.\u201c On 7 November, another prison officer reported that: \u201c... during the riot of that night I spent the majority of the time in the T.V. room with the prisoners who were not participating in the disturbance. 740007, Golder was in this room with me and to the best of my knowledge took no part in the riot. His presence with me can be borne out by officer ... who observed us both from the outside.\u201c Golder was returned to his ordinary cell the same day. l5. Meanwhile, the prison authorities had been considering the various statements, and on 10 November prepared a list of charges which might be preferred against prisoners, including Golder, for offences against prison discipline. Entries relating thereto were made in Golder\u2019s prison record. No such charge was eventually preferred against him and the entries in his prison record were marked \u201ccharges not proceeded with\u201c. Those entries were expunged from the prison record in 1971 during the examination of the applicant\u2019s case by the Commission.\n\nOn 20 March 1970, Golder addressed a petition to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, that is, the Home Secretary. He requested a transfer to some other prison and added: \u201cI understand that a statement wrongly accusing me of participation in the events of 24th October last, made by Officer Laird, is lodged in my prison record. I suspect that it is this wrong statement that has recently prevented my being recommended by the local parole board for parole. \u201cI would respectfully request permission to consult a solicitor with a view to taking civil action for libel in respect of this statement .... Alternatively, I would request that an independent examination of my record be allowed by Mrs. G.M. Bishop who is magistrate. I would accept her assurance that this statement is not part of my record and be willing to accept then that the libel against me has not materially harmed me except for the two weeks I spent in the separate cells and so civil action would not be then necessary, providing that an apology was given to me for the libel ....\u201c\n\nIn England the matter of contacts of convicted prisoners with persons outside their place of detention is governed by the Prison Act 1952, as amended and subordinate legislation made under that Act. Section 47, sub-section I, of the Prison Act provides that \u201cthe Secretary of State may make rules for the regulation and management of prisoners ... and for the ... treatment ... discipline and control of persons required to be detained ....\u201c The rules made by the Home Secretary in the exercise of this power are the Prison Rules 1964, which were laid before Parliament and have the status of a Statutory Instrument. The relevant provisions concerning communications between prisoners and persons outside prison are contained in Rules 33, 34 and 37 as follows: \u201cLetters and visits generally Rule 33 (1) The Secretary of State may, with a view to securing discipline and good order or the prevention of crime in the interests of any persons, impose restrictions, either generally or in a particular case, upon the communications to be permitted between a prisoner and other persons. (2) Except as provided by statute or these Rules, a prisoner shall not be permitted to communicate with any outside person, or that person with him, without the leave of the Secretary of State. ... Personal letters and visits Rule 34 ... (8) A prisoner shall not be entitled under this Rule to communicate with any person in connection with any legal or other business, or with any person other than a relative or friend, except with the leave of the Secretary of State. ... Legal advisers Rule 37 (1) The legal adviser of a prisoner in any legal proceedings, civil or criminal, to which the prisoner is a party shall be afforded reasonable facilities for interviewing him in connection with those proceedings, and may do so out of hearing but in the sight of an officer. (2) A prisoner\u2019s legal adviser may, with the leave of the Secretary of State, interview the prisoner in connection with any other legal business in the sight and hearing of an officer.\u201c\n\nOn 6 April 1970, the Home Office directed the prison governor to notify Golder of the reply to his petition of 20 March as follows: \u201cThe Secretary of State has fully considered your petition but is not prepared to grant your request for transfer, nor can he find grounds for taking any action in regard to the other matters raised in your petition.\u201c\n\nBefore the Commission, Golder submitted two complaints relating respectively to the stopping of his letters (as mentioned above at paragraph 13) and to the refusal of the Home Secretary to permit him to consult a solicitor. On 30 March 1971, the Commission declared the first complaint inadmissible, as all domestic remedies had not been exhausted, but accepted the second for consideration of the merits under Articles 6 para. 1 and 8 (art. 6-1, art. 8) of the Convention.\n\nGolder was released from prison on parole on 12 July 1972.\n\nIn their report, the Commission expressed the opinion:\n\nunanimously, that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) guarantees a right of access to the courts;\n\nunanimously, that in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), whether read alone or together with other Articles of the Convention, there are no inherent limitations on the right of a convicted prisoner to institute proceedings and for this purpose to have unrestricted access to a lawyer; and that consequently the restrictions imposed by the present practice of the United Kingdom authorities are inconsistent with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1);\n\nby seven votes to two, that Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1) is applicable to the facts of the present case;\n\nthat the same facts which constitute a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) constitute also a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) (by eight votes to one, as explained to the Court by the Principal Delegate on 12 October 1974). The Commission furthermore expressed the opinion that the right of access to the courts guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is not qualified by the requirement \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201c. In the application bringing the case before the Court, the Government made objection to this opinion of the Commission but stated in their memorial that they no longer wished to argue the issue.\n\nThe following final submissions were made to the Court at the oral hearing on 12 October 1974 in the afternoon.\n\nfor the Government: \u201cThe United Kingdom Government respectfully submit to the Court that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention does not confer on the applicant a right of access to the courts, but confers only a right in any proceedings he may institute to a hearing that is fair and in accordance with the other requirements of the paragraph. The Government submit that in consequence the refusal of the United Kingdom Government to allow the applicant in this case to consult a lawyer was not a violation of Article 6 (art. 6). In the alternative, if the Court finds that the rights conferred by Article 6 (art. 6) include in general a right of access to courts, then the United Kingdom Government submit that the right of access to the courts is not unlimited in the case of persons under detention, and that accordingly the imposing of a reasonable restraint on recourse to the courts by the applicant was permissible in the interest of prison order and discipline, and that the refusal of the United Kingdom Government to allow the applicant to consult a lawyer was within the degree of restraint permitted, and therefore did not constitute a violation of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. The United Kingdom Government further submit that control over the applicant\u2019s correspondence while he was in prison was a necessary consequence of the deprivation of his liberty, and that the action of the United Kingdom Government was therefore not a violation of Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), and that the action of the United Kingdom Government in any event fell within the exceptions provided by Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2), since the restriction imposed was in accordance with law, and it was within the power of appreciation of the Government to judge that the restriction was necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder or crime. In the light of these submissions, Mr. President, I respectfully ask this honourable Court, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, to hold that the United Kingdom Government have not in this case committed a breach of Article 6 (art. 6) or Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\u201c\n\nfor the Commission: \u201cThe questions to which the Court is requested to reply are the following: (1) Does Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the European Convention on Human Rights secure to persons desiring to institute civil proceedings a right of access to the courts? (2) If Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) secures such a right of access, are there inherent limitations relating to this right, or its exercise, which apply to the facts of the present case? (3) Can a convicted prisoner who wishes to write to his lawyer in order to institute civil proceedings rely on the protection given in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention to respect for correspondence? (4) According to the answers given to the foregoing questions, do the facts of the present case disclose the existence of a violation of Article 6 and of Article 8 (art. 6, art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights?\u201c"}

with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Hikmettin Garbul (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 July 1999.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr A. Terece, a lawyer practising in \u0130zmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 20 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant during police custody and his right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1967 and was serving his sentence in Ayd\u0131n prison at the time of his application to the Court.\n\nA. The detention in police custody and the medical certificates concerning the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant\n\nOn an unspecified date an arrest warrant was issued in respect of the applicant because of his alleged involvement with the PKK, an illegal armed organisation. After receiving an anonymous phone call, police officers arrested the applicant on 2 July 1997 at around 02.00 a.m. The police also searched the house where the applicant stayed. The search and seizure protocol drafted by the police officers and signed by the applicant indicates that he consented to the search.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he was arrested and taken into custody on 30 June 1997 from his house in the Eskiizmir district and that while he was in custody he was subjected to various forms of torture. In particular, he submitted that he was beaten, sworn at, threatened, blindfolded, given electric shocks and hosed with pressurized water. He further claimed that his mother fainted when the police officers started to beat him at his home at the time of his arrest.\n\nAccording to the medical report drawn up on 2 July 1997 at around 11.40 a.m. the applicant complained of blows to his chest. The doctor found that the applicant had a 1 cm graze on the right side of his forehead and a hyperaemic region (redness) in the middle of his chest.\n\nThe applicant was interrogated by the police officers at the Anti-terror branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on 3 July 1997.\n\nAccording to the medical report drafted on 3 July 1997 the applicant complained of blows to his chest. The doctor found that the applicant had a 1 cm graze on the right side of his forehead and a hyperaemic region (redness) in the middle of his chest and a graze of 1 cm on his right leg.\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 3 July 1997 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court. The applicant stated to the prosecutor, inter alia, that Agit (code name) threatened him and told him to collect money for the PKK while he was working as a musician at wedding ceremonies and that he had to give money from his own pocket. He further gave information about some people and denied knowing Mr M.K, Mr F.\u00d6, Mr S.T or Mr F.K. He stated that if he did some things it was because he was forced to do so and that he was a victim. When he was asked about his previous statements given to the police, he claimed that these statements were his true statements.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was brought before the Izmir State Security Court. The applicant reiterated, inter alia, that he was threatened and forced by Agit and some other PKK militants to collect money and to conduct a one minute silence to Kurdistan martyrs during wedding ceremonies. He submitted that he was not a member of the organization. He acknowledged his previous statements given to the public prosecutor and denied his statements given to the police. He claimed that they were not his and that he had just signed them. The court ordered his remand in custody.\n\nThe applicant alleges that during his transfer to prison he was beaten and sworn at by the soldiers.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment accusing the applicant of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. He requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the criminal proceedings against the applicant commenced before the Izmir State Security Court.\n\nOn 19 August 1997 the Izmir State Security Court decided that the case brought against the applicant be joined to the case brought against twenty\u2011five other suspects. In that hearing the applicant's representative submitted that the applicant's statements had been taken under duress and the applicant had only given money to Agit because he mistook him for the organiser of a wedding.\n\nIn a hearing held on 31 March 1998 the applicant stated that he did not accept the statements of some of the co-accused, claiming that they had given these statements under torture.\n\nFollowing the decision of the court to join another case-file to the trial, the public prosecutor, on 12 March 1998, accused the applicant of membership of an illegal organisation and requested that he be convicted and charged under Article 168 \u00a7 2 and Article 5 of Law no. 3713.\n\nOn 21 May 1998 the Izmir State Security Court, referring to the statements of Mr A.P., a photo identification report, statements of Mr S.\u00c7. (\u201cAgit\u201d) and Mr S.T., the gun found buried in the applicant's garden and the findings of the ballistic report in this respect, held that it had been established that the applicant had entered into a permanent hierarchical and organic relationship with the organization. The court, referring to the aforementioned evidence, stated that it did not find the applicant's denials convincing. The applicant was convicted under Article 168 \u00a7 2 and Article 5 of Law no. 3713 and sentenced to twelve years and six months' imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant appealed. In his petition, he submitted, inter alia, that the court had taken into account, in his view, statements given under duress. He also suggested that the statements of those who accused him had been obtained through illegal methods, in violation of Article 135 (a) of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 23 February 1999 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nC. Relevant Procedure before the Court\n\nBy a letter dated 28 July 1999 the applicant lodged an application with the Court. By letters dated 14 November 1999, 17 February 2000, 12 July 2000 and 29 September 2000 the Registry requested the applicant to submit supporting documents in respect of his complaint pertaining to his alleged ill-treatment.\n\nD. Investigation instigated into the applicant's alleged ill-treatment\n\nOn 1 November 2000 the applicant filed a complaint with the \u0130zmir public prosecutor (hereinafter: \u201cthe prosecutor\u201d) against the police officers at the anti-terror branch of the Izmir Security Directorate (hereinafter: \u201cthe police\u201d). The applicant submitted, inter alia, that while he was held in police custody between 30 June and 2 July 1997 he had been subjected to torture. He gave details of the alleged ill-treatment and claimed that when he was brought before the doctor for a medical examination, two police officers were in the room. He further submitted that the police were also next to him while he gave his statements to the public prosecutor and the court on 3 July 1997. Finally, he claimed that he had been beaten and sworn at during his arrest in the presence of his family members and that he was also beaten while he was transferred to remand in custody. He claimed that he did not know their names but would be able to recognise some of them if he saw them.\n\nOn an unspecified date the prosecutor heard the applicant who repeated that he had been ill-treated while he was held in detention.\n\nOn 11 December 2000 the prosecutor decided not to initiate criminal proceedings against the police on account of lack of evidence. In particular, the prosecutor noted that the findings of the medical report issued at the end of the applicant's stay in custody (3 July 1997) mirrored those in the medical report drawn up on the day of his arrest (2 July 1997). In this decision, the prosecutor noted that the applicant was caught while hiding in a house in theYamanlar district.\n\nOn 7 February 2001 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court dismissed the applicant's objections."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 62279/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Hamdi Atiman (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 17 November 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Kiran, a lawyer practising in Van. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 27 September 2011 the complaint concerning Article 2 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n\nFollowing the communication of the application, the Government, but not the applicant, filed further written observations (Rule 54 \u00a7 2). However, the applicant indicated his wish to pursue his application.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Van.\n\nAccording to the incident and the crime scene investigation reports, upon receipt of intelligence that terrorists were hiding in the area, on 24 June 2008 a large group of gendarme officers from the Hakkari Mountain Commando Brigade blocked the road near the village of Armutd\u00fcz\u00fc in the Y\u00fcksekova district. At about 1.30 a.m. the gendarme officers stopped a lorry on suspicion of fuel smuggling. Subsequently, another lorry approached the gendarme officers. The applicant was travelling in this vehicle and it was being driven by his cousin, N.A. The soldiers ordered them to stop, but N.A. continued to drive. According to the report drafted by the gendarme officers, the driver attempted to escape and the gendarme officers fired a warning shot in the air and then fired at the tyres of the lorry to stop it. According to the applicant, they were driving down a steep hill at high speed, and as the brakes had failed, they could not stop. They maintained that they had shouted from the window that the brakes were not working and N.A. had tried to avoid hitting the other lorry, which was parked in the middle of the street, by trying to pass it on the right. He then headed towards the hills, where there was a group of gendarme officers. The gendarme officers opened fire, first in the air and then at the vehicle. The applicant was wounded in the hip and his cousin in the leg during the incident as a result of ricochet bullets.\n\nThe crime scene investigation report revealed that there were no bullet holes on the left side or the back of the lorry. Three of the tyres were flat, namely the two front tyres and the rear right tyre. Eight bullet holes were observed on the right wing over the tyres, three bullet holes in the petrol tank, a bullet entry and exit hole on the front right door, and another bullet hole on the right wheel rim. The gendarme officers further collected a total of nine bullet cases from the scene of the incident.\n\nOn the same day, a major from the District Gendarmerie wrote to the Y\u00fcksekova Public Prosecutor and requested authorisation to search the two vehicles which had been stopped by the gendarmes. Upon receipt of authorisation, the gendarme officers searched the two lorries. They found sixty\u2011six barrels of smuggled fuel in the first lorry and forty-five barrels in the applicant\u2019s cousin\u2019s lorry. No other illegal items were found in the vehicles. The applicant\u2019s cousin, N.A., declined to sign the search report.\n\nAlso on the same day, two gendarme officers tested the lorry belonging to the applicant\u2019s cousin in the presence of the village mayor. They reported that the vehicle had three flat tyres, that there were four bullet holes in the petrol tank, that the engine was working correctly and that the brake system was intact.\n\nSubsequently, on the same day, the applicant\u2019s cousin gave a statement to the Y\u00fcksekova Public Prosecutor and stated that the applicant had been taken to Van Hospital. He requested that criminal proceedings be initiated against the gendarme officers who had used force against them. He emphasised that when he had been told to stop he had been driving down a steep hill at high speed, and when he could not stop, he had shouted from the window that the brakes were not working. He had had no intention of escaping from the gendarmes. He further denied that he had been transporting smuggled fuel and maintained that the barrels found by the gendarmes must have been from the other vehicle.\n\nThe public prosecutor also took statements from two eyewitnesses to the incident. These two individuals had also been in the lorry which had been stopped by the gendarmes on suspicion of fuel smuggling. According to their statements, while they were being questioned by the gendarme officers about the barrels found in their lorry, they saw another vehicle approaching. The gendarmes ordered the driver to stop but the driver failed to obey, shouting from the window that the brakes had failed. The driver then tried to pass their vehicle, which was blocking the road, on the right. The gendarmes opened fire, first into the air and then at the tyres. Both witnesses stated that the driver had no intention of escaping and was shouting that he was unable to stop.\n\nOn 15 December 2008, the applicant\u2019s cousin, N.A., gave a statement to the Hakkari Public Prosecutor. He explained that on the day of the incident, while he was driving down a steep hill, the gendarme officers ordered him to stop. He called out that he would stop, but the gendarmes opened fire and he was shot in the leg. He was able to stop the vehicle by using the handbrake. He stated that he had had no intention or reason to escape.\n\nOn 20 February 2009 a statement was taken from the applicant at Iskele police station. He explained that on the day of the incident he had been travelling in his cousin\u2019s lorry. His cousin had told him that there was a problem with the brake system of the vehicle. When they approached the checkpoint, a gendarme officer ordered them to stop, and they shouted out that there was a problem with the brakes and that they were not able to stop. The gendarme thought that they were trying to escape and fired a shot in the air and then started shooting at them. The applicant was shot in the hip. He concluded that the gendarme who had shot at them was not at fault, as he must have thought that they were trying to escape.\n\nOn 22 July 2008 statements were taken from the accused gendarme officers by a sergeant from the Yenik\u00f6pr\u00fc Gendarme Command. They all stated that they had ordered the driver of the lorry to stop on suspicion of fuel smuggling. The driver initially stopped the vehicle. When the officers asked about the load of the lorry, he started driving away in an attempt to escape. The officers explained that they first fired warning shots in the air and then shot at the tyres to stop the lorry. They considered that the force they had used had been proportionate as they had only used their guns, whereas they were also equipped with heavy machine guns and hand grenades.\n\nBased on the evidence in the file, on 26 April 2009 the Y\u00fcsekova Public Prosecutor delivered a decision not to prosecute. He concluded that the use of force had been legal pursuant to Article 11 of Law no. 2803 on the establishment, duties and jurisdiction of the gendarmerie and section 39 (i) of the Regulation on the Duties and Powers of the Gendarmerie. He found it established that the driver of the vehicle in which the applicant was travelling had disobeyed the order to stop and had continued driving. He further pointed out that the lorry had not stopped and that the officers had first fired warning shots in the air and had then shot at the tyres of the lorry.\n\nOn 4 June 2009 the Van Assize Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding the decision of the Y\u00fcksekova Public Prosecutor to be in line with domestic law."}

of the Swiss Confederation (\u201cthe Government\u201c) on 13 March and 13 April 1987 respectively, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 11368/85) against Switzerland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swiss national, Mr. Edmund Sch\u00f6nenberger, and a Turkish national, Mr. Mehmet Durmaz, on 10 January 1985. The Commission\u2019s request referred to the declaration whereby Switzerland recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46) and to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48); the Government\u2019s application referred to Articles 45, 47 and 48 (art. 45, art. 47, art. 48). Both sought a decision from the Court as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 8 (art. 8). The Commission also sought a decision under Article 10 (art. 10).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings. The President of the Court gave Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger leave to appear on his own behalf, while Mr. Durmaz designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, the elected judge of Swiss nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 3 (b)). On 23 May 1987, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other five members, namely Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Sir Vincent Evans, Mr. R. Bernhardt, Mr. A. M. Donner and Mr. J. De Meyer (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 4) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr. J. Cremona, substitute judge, replaced Mr. Donner, who was unable to attend (Rules 22 \u00a7 1 and 24 \u00a7 1).\n\nMr. Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted those who would be appearing before the Court on the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 \u00a7 1). In accordance with the order made in consequence on 7 August 1987, the Registrar received the Government\u2019s memorial on 21 September 1987 and the applicants\u2019 memorial on 7 October. On 19 November, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nHaving consulted - through the Registrar - the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the applicants, the President directed on 1 December 1987 that the oral proceedings should commence on 22 February 1988 (Rule 38). On 15 January 1988, he gave Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger and his assistant leave to plead in German (Rule 27 \u00a7 3).\n\nThe hearing was held in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting immediately beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr. O. Jacot-Guillarmod, Head of the Department of International Affairs, Federal Department of Justice, Agent, Mr. R. Levi, former federal judge, Mr. B. M\u00fcnger, Federal Department of Justice, Counsel;\n\nfor the Commission Mr. S. Trechsel, Delegate;\n\nfor Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger Mr. E. Sch\u00f6nenberger, Rechtsanwalt, Applicant; Ms. B. Hug, Rechtsanw\u00e4ltin, Assistant;\n\nfor Mr. Durmaz, applicant Mr. J.-P. Garbade, avocat, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr. Jacot-Guillarmod and Mr. Levi for the Government, Mr. Trechsel for the Commission and Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger, Ms. Hug and Mr. Garbade for the applicants, as well as their replies to its questions. At the hearing, the Commission, the Government and the applicants lodged with the registry various documents, either at the President\u2019s request or on their own initiative.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first applicant, Edmund Sch\u00f6nenberger, who is a Swiss citizen born in 1942, practises as a Rechtsanwalt (lawyer) in Z\u00fcrich. The second applicant, Mehmet Durmaz, who is a Turkish national born in 1950, lives at Onex, in Switzerland. He is a taxi-driver.\n\nA. Stopping of a letter and enclosure from Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger to Mr. Durmaz\n\nOn 16 February 1984, acting on a statement by one O, the district prosecutor (Bezirksanwalt) for Pf\u00e4ffikon (Canton of Z\u00fcrich) issued a warrant for Mr. Durmaz\u2019s arrest, in connection with suspected offences under federal legislation relating to the misuse of drugs. The applicant was arrested on the same day by the Geneva police and taken to Z\u00fcrich the following day, where he was questioned for the first time by officials from the prosecutor\u2019s office. He was further questioned and also confronted with other suspects on 23 and 24 February, and on each occasion he cooperated by answering all the questions put to him.\n\nMr. Durmaz\u2019s wife, who had been informed of the arrest on 16 February, spoke on the telephone to the Pf\u00e4ffikon district prosecutor on 20 and 24 February. On these occasions she asked him whether her husband had a lawyer. He replied that he had not but added that he would take care of it. She also wrote to her husband on 21 and 24 February. In the second letter, which reached him on 28 February, she expressed the hope that the \u201clawyer\u201c - whose name she did not mention - \u201cwould look after [him]\u201c. On 24 February, she asked Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger to take charge of Mr. Durmaz\u2019s defence. The first applicant immediately called the district prosecutor to advise him and to say that he would be sending authorisation forms and a letter. Also, on 24 February, he sent a letter and enclosure to the district prosecutor\u2019s office, as required by the relevant legislation, requesting the district prosecutor to forward them to the addressee. The enclosure comprised a copy of the covering letter to the district prosecutor, two forms giving authority to act and a letter to Mr. Durmaz, which read as follows (translation from the German): \u201cSir, I am instructed by your wife to undertake your defence. You will find enclosed two forms giving me authority to act for you. If you wish to authorise me to represent you, please send one of the forms to the district prosecutor and return the other one to me (duly signed). It is my duty to point out to you that you are entitled to refuse to make any statement. Anything you say may be used in evidence against you. If you choose to remain silent, the district prosecutor will have to prove your guilt by other means (witnesses, etc.). He will usually then try to influence you by arguing that in that case you will remain in custody on remand until such time as he has questioned witnesses, other suspects, etc. If this does not worry you (i.e. a possible prolongation of your detention on remand), it will be to your advantage to exercise your right not to make any statement. Once I have received your authority to act, I shall apply for permission to visit you and will come and see you. At all events, be patient: you will have to be released at some stage! Yours faithfully ...\u201c\n\nThe district prosecutor probably received the letter and enclosure for Mr. Durmaz on Monday 27 February, but kept them from him without telling him that he had received them. On the same day, he asked Mr. Durmaz to choose a lawyer. Mr. Durmaz, being unable to pay for one, applied for the only Z\u00fcrich lawyer he knew, Mr. Garbade, to be assigned officially to him; the presiding judge of the Pf\u00e4ffikon District Court duly appointed Mr. Garbade on 1 March.\n\nIn an order made on 1 March, the prosecutor\u2019s office decided not to communicate to Mr. Durmaz the letter and forms which were intended for him. It did so on the following ground (translation from the German): \u201cAs long as Edmund Sch\u00f6nenberger is not the suspect\u2019s authorised legal representative, the general provisions of the Prisons Ordinance [see paragraph 18 below] apply to him. Section 53(3) prohibits the forwarding of letters concerning the preparation of a case for trial. In the present letter, Edmund Sch\u00f6nenberger has recommended to the suspect a particular course of conduct for the preparation of the case. In virtue of the aforementioned provision, his letter will therefore not be forwarded.\u201c The prosecutor\u2019s office returned to Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger the said documents together with the copy of the covering letter.\n\nOn various dates between 5 and 23 March 1984, Mr. Durmaz was again questioned and confronted with other suspects. He also received visits from Mr. Garbade. On 8 March, Mr. Garbade had asked the presiding judge of the District Court to offer Mr. Durmaz the possibility of choosing between Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger and himself as his defence lawyer. The two lawyers had a conversation on 9 March, as a result of which they agreed that Mr. Garbade would continue to assist Mr. Durmaz and that Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger would challenge the order made on 1 March (see paragraphs 14 to 16 below).\n\nMr. Durmaz was freed on 23 March 1984. On 29 May 1985 the Z\u00fcrich district prosecutor ordered that he had no case to answer as it could not be excluded beyond all possible doubt that someone else had been mistaken for him. In respect of his detention on remand, the prosecutor awarded him 3,000 Swiss francs (CHF) which the Z\u00fcrich District Court increased to 3,565 CHF on 30 October 1985.\n\nB. The appeals against the Pf\u00e4ffikon district prosecutor\u2019s order of 1 March 1984\n\nThe applicants lodged two appeals against the order of 1 March 1984 (see paragraph 11 above); the first of these was rejected by the Department of Justice of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich on 19 March 1984, and the second was dismissed by the presiding judge of the Pf\u00e4ffikon District Court on 11 April 1984.\n\nOn 7 April 1984, they lodged a public-law appeal with the Federal Court against the decision of the Department of Justice; they alleged an infringement of the federal Constitution and of the Convention. During the proceedings they stated that they did not propose to challenge the dismissal of their second appeal.\n\nIn a judgment on 20 June, which was notified on 6 November 1984, the Federal Court allowed the appeal in part. It noted in the first place that Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger could not rely on the privileges conferred on prisoners\u2019 defence lawyers under section 53(3) of the Prisons Ordinance. The Federal Court added that the prosecutor\u2019s office had not infringed either the Constitution or the Convention by intercepting Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger\u2019s letter to Mr. Durmaz, since it related to pending criminal proceedings and gave the addressee advice on the behaviour to adopt during the investigation. On the other hand, the Federal Court held that the decision to withhold the two authorisation forms and the copy of the covering letter to the prosecutor\u2019s office was contrary to the Constitution: since these documents did not relate to pending criminal proceedings, section 53(3) could not be relied on in respect of them. The Federal Court also pointed out that a person who has been charged with a criminal offence is at all times entitled to ask for a lawyer and to receive a form for giving authority to act. It concluded that the disputed measure was a disproportionate restriction on freedom of correspondence and on the rights of the defence. It consequently set aside the Department of Justice\u2019s decision and awarded the applicants costs of 500 CHF.\n\nII. NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND CASE-LAW\n\nAccording to the general principles of criminal procedure, a suspect is under no obligation to make any statements. The Federal Court has held that, under the Constitution, he has the right to remain silent and that he cannot normally be held to have culpably obstructed the proceedings on the sole ground that he has refused to reply to questions, unless there has been some abuse of the right (Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court, vol. 106 (1980), part I a), p. 8, and vol. 109 (1983), part I a), p. 169).\n\nIn the Canton of Z\u00fcrich, the monitoring of correspondence with persons in custody is governed by section 53 of the District Prisons Ordinance of 19 April 1972 (Verordnung des Kantons Z\u00fcrich vom 19. April 1972 \u00fcber die Bezirksgef\u00e4ngnisse), which was made under section 73 of the law of 6 July 1941 by which the Swiss Criminal Code was enacted. Section 53(3) reads as follows (translation from German): \u201cNo correspondence with co-prisoners and former co-prisoners (except for close relatives) shall be allowed. Letters jeopardising the purpose of detention or prison security shall not be forwarded; letters relating to pending criminal proceedings shall be forwarded only if they form part of correspondence with a defence lawyer. A prisoner shall be informed if a letter is not forwarded.\u201c\n\nIn 1973, the Federal Court considered the constitutionality of various provisions of the Z\u00fcrich Ordinance of 1972. As regards the restrictions on freedom of correspondence, it noted the following (translation from German): \u201cSection 53 lays down in particular that letters \u2018whose content is improper\u2019 or which relate to pending criminal proceedings shall not be forwarded. Correspondence with co-prisoners or former co-prisoners is likewise prohibited. On the other hand, communications addressed to supervising authorities or to a defence lawyer are not subject to any restrictions. The applicant alleges that prohibiting communications \u2018whose content is improper\u2019 goes much too far and leaves too great a discretion to the officials responsible for monitoring correspondence. In his submission, the prohibition should apply only to communications whose content is \u2018illicit\u2019. This change of wording would make no appreciable difference, since the second concept is likewise very imprecise in the present context. The applicant does not dispute the need to prohibit the dispatch of letters with a particular type of content, and that is the very purpose of the monitoring. It is clear, therefore, that any correspondence which might assist in the preparation of escape plans or the commission of fresh criminal offences, or which could have an impermissible influence on criminal proceedings (danger of collusion) must be prohibited. Even assuming that it is in principle desirable to maintain contacts with the outside world, these contacts must not compromise the purpose of detention. Moreover, the supervising authorities must also be given the right to hold back any communications which might jeopardise order in the prison. Conversely, the authorities cannot refuse to forward communications which do not jeopardise either the purpose of detention or order in the prison and which are permissible in their quantity (s. 52). It is accordingly of little consequence whether or not the supervising authority approves the content of such communications (cf., on the legal situation in Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 14 March 1972, vol. 33, no. 1). It is not possible to make an accurate general statement of where the line should be drawn, since it depends on the particular circumstances of each case. The general principle laid down in the disputed ordinance accordingly cannot be criticised as being unconstitutional, at least not if regard is had to the fact that correspondence with the supervising authorities and defence lawyers is not subject to any marked degree of control.\u201c (Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court, vol. 99, part I a), pp. 288-289) PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nThe applicants applied to the Commission on 10 January 1985 (application no. 11368/85). They claimed that the Pf\u00e4ffikon district prosecutor\u2019s stopping of the letter from Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger to Mr. Durmaz had violated their right to respect for their correspondence (Article 8 of the Convention) (art. 8) and their freedom of expression (Article 10) (art. 10).\n\nThe Commission declared the application admissible on 4 March 1986. In its report of 12 December 1986 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) and that no separate issue arose under Article 10 (art. 10). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment. CONCLUDING SUBMISSIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nAt the hearing, the Government confirmed the submissions contained in their written pleadings. In them they invited the Court \u201cto conclude that in the present case the non-forwarding of the letter in issue addressed by the first applicant to the second applicant, who was detained on remand and did not know the sender of the letter, did not constitute a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention or of any other provision of that instrument\u201c."}

originated in an application (no. 39652/98) against the French Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Tunisian national, Mr Nouri Maaouia (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 December 1997.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the length of proceedings he had brought on 12 August 1994 for the rescission of an exclusion order, which proceedings had ended with the judgment of the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal of 26 January 1998, had been unreasonable, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe case was referred to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe case was assigned to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). On 12 January 1999 the Chamber decided to adjourn the examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings for rescission of the exclusion order (Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible [Note by the Registry. The Court\u2019s decision is obtainable from the Registry.].\n\nOn 1 February 2000 the Chamber, composed of the following judges: Sir Nicolas Bratza, President, Mr J.-P. Costa, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr K. Jungwiert, Mr K. Traja and Mr M. Ugrekhelidze, and of Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar, decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties being opposed thereto (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).\n\nThe composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. In a decision of 22 March 2000 [Note by the Registry. The Court\u2019s decision is obtainable from the Registry.] the Grand Chamber declared the remainder of the application admissible, while reserving the issue of the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe applicant and the French Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) each filed written observations on the merits of the case.\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 5 July 2000. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr R. Abraham, Director of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mrs C. d\u2019Urso, Head of the Human Rights Office, Department of European and International Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Mr P. Boussaroque, administrative court judge, on secondment to the Legal Affairs Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Counsel; (b) for the applicant Mr A. Chemama, of the Nice Bar, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr Chemama and Mr Abraham.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1958 in Tunisia, entered France in 1980 at the age of 22. On 14 September 1992 he married a French national, an invalid whose disability had been assessed at 80%, with whom he had been living since 1983.\n\nOn 1 December 1988 the Alpes-Maritimes Assize Court sentenced the applicant to six years\u2019 imprisonment for armed robbery and armed assault with intent for offences committed in 1985. He was released on 14 April 1990.\n\nOn 8 August 1991 the Minister of the Interior made a deportation order against him. The order was served on the applicant, who had been unaware of its existence, on 6 October 1992, when he attended the Nice Centre for Administrative Formalities in order to regularise his status.\n\nHe refused to travel to Tunisia and was prosecuted for failing to comply with a deportation order. On 19 November 1992 the Nice Criminal Court sentenced him to one year\u2019s imprisonment and made an order excluding him from French territory for ten years. That decision was upheld on appeal by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal on 7 June 1993. An appeal on points of law was dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 1 June 1994 on the ground that the applicant had failed to challenge the legality of the deportation order in the courts below.\n\nOn 22 July 1994 the applicant applied to the Criminal Cases Review Board of the Court of Cassation for a review of the criminal proceedings that had resulted in his being imprisoned for one year and banned from French territory for ten years. In a judgment of 28 April 1997, which was served on 22 September 1997, the Court of Cassation dismissed that application.\n\nA. Proceedings before the administrative courts for an order quashing the deportation order made against the applicant\n\nIn December 1992 the applicant sought judicial review of the deportation order. In a judgment of 14 February 1994 the Nice Administrative Court quashed the deportation order of 8 August 1991, inter alia, on the ground that no notice had been served on the applicant requiring him to appear before the Deportation Board. That judgment became final on 14 March 1994 after being served on the Minister of the Interior.\n\nB. Application for rescission of the exclusion order\n\nOn the strength of the administrative court\u2019s judgment of 14 February 1994 quashing the deportation order, the applicant applied to the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal on 12 August 1994 for rescission of the ten-year exclusion order made by the Nice Criminal Court on 19 November 1992. He contended that he was married to a French national and held a provisional residence permit.\n\nIn a letter of 6 July 1995 the applicant reminded the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the terms of his application for rescission. Noting that the application had been outstanding for some time, he asked the office to arrange for it to be heard and a ruling given. On 12 July 1995 the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office requested the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Nice tribunal de grande instance for its opinion on the merits of the application and any information that would assist the court in deciding whether the exclusion order should be rescinded. On 19 September 1995 Nice Central Police Station sent the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office the results of an inquiry concerning the applicant.\n\nOn 3 November 1997 the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Court of Appeal informed the applicant that the case would be heard on 26 January 1998. On that date the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal granted the applicant\u2019s application and rescinded the exclusion order on the ground that the Nice Administrative Court had quashed the deportation order.\n\nC. Steps taken by the applicant to regularise his immigration status\n\nThe applicant also sought to regularise his status with the immigration authorities. He initially obtained acknowledgment forms for applications for provisional residence permits (not work permits) for renewable three-month periods. On 4 September 1995, however, he was given a new three-month residence permit incorporating the right to seek employment.\n\nOn 14 September 1995 the applicant applied to the prefect for the Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement for a residence permit allowing him to live and work in France for a prolonged period, as he was married to a French citizen. On 9 April 1996 the applicant received notice of a decision dated 2 April 1996 refusing him a residence permit. He appealed to the Nice Administrative Court, but his appeal was dismissed on 27 September 1996.\n\nThe applicant appealed on 24 December 1996 to the Lyons Administrative Court of Appeal. On 29 August 1997 the President of that court ordered the transfer of the file to the Marseilles Administrative Court of Appeal \u2013 the court with jurisdiction \u2013 where the case is currently pending.\n\nOn 21 July 1998 the applicant obtained a temporary residence permit valid for one year (from 13 July 1998 to 12 July 1999). Recently he obtained a ten-year residence permit with the right to seek employment."}

the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Austrian national, Werner Gabriel (\u201cthe applicant\u201d).\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms Baumgartner-Gabriel, a lawyer practising in Graz. The Austrian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant complained, in particular, that there was no public hearing in the disciplinary proceedings against him before the Administrative Court.\n\nOn 1 December 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Graz.\n\nThe applicant was, at the time of the events, a civil servant in a public employment relationship with the Styria Regional Government (Landesregierung). He worked at the Department for Legal Affairs (Traffic Department).\n\nOn 17 May 1993 the Department for Legal Affairs (Human Resources) laid disciplinary information against the applicant.\n\nThe Disciplinary Commission at the Office of the Regional Styria Government (Disziplinarkommission des Amtes der Landesregierung) decided, on 21 June 1993, to institute the main disciplinary proceedings on account of seventeen specific charges dating from December 1990 to April 1993 and suspended the applicant from his duties (Einleitungs- und Suspendierungsbeschluss).\n\nOn 21 September 1994 the Disciplinary Commission decided to hold a hearing (Verhandlungsbeschluss) in the disciplinary matter against the applicant, charging him on twenty-four counts. However, in the summons for the hearing the Disciplinary Commission informed the applicant on 2 October 2005 that only counts 1 to 14 would be subject matter of the hearing.\n\nA hearing was held in presence of the applicant and his counsel on 7 December 1995 following which the Disciplinary Commission held the applicant liable in respect of ten counts of misbehaviour. It imposed a disciplinary penalty of immediate retirement with a deduction of 20% of his pension benefits. On the remaining four counts the Disciplinary Commission found no reason to take further action.\n\nOn 7 November 1996 the Senior Disciplinary Board at the Office of the Styria Regional Government (Disziplinaroberkommission des Amtes der Landesregierung) on the basis of the result of an oral hearing upheld this decision with regard to six counts, but found no reason for criticism as regards the remaining four counts. As a result the disciplinary penalty was reduced by setting the deduction of the applicant's pension benefits at 15%.\n\nThe applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court on 9 January 1997. The applicant also requested the Constitutional Court to hold a public hearing.\n\nThe Constitutional Court declined to deal with the applicant's complaint for lack of prospect of success on 9 June 1998 and, on 24 June 1998, remitted the case to the Administrative Court at the applicant's request.\n\nOn 23 September 1998 the applicant supplemented his complaint as requested by the Administrative Court and requested again a public hearing to be held. In his complaint he argued that the Senior Disciplinary Board had not been properly composed and that there were inconsistencies as to the number of charges in the decision to institute proceedings, the decision to hold a hearing and for which he was eventually held liable. Further, the authorities had not properly gathered the evidence and had erred in its assessment.\n\nOn 15 December 1999 (served on the applicant's counsel on 24 January 2000) the Administrative Court, without a hearing, dismissed the applicant's complaint as unfounded."}

and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Jerzy Lewak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 23 May 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 14 September 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Rejowiec Fabryczny.\n\nA. The alleged ill-treatment of the applicant\n\nIt appears that in November 2002 the Che\u0142m District Prosecutor charged the applicant with armed robbery. On an unspecified date in November 2002 the court ordered his detention on remand. He was detained in the Che\u0142m Prison. In connection with the criminal investigation against the applicant, the District Prosecutor ordered the applicant to provide a sample of his body odour.\n\nAccording to the applicant, on 13 March 2003 he was called to the interrogation room in the Che\u0142m Prison where he was informed that he was to provide the required samples. However, the applicant stated that he would provide them only in the presence of his lawyer. According to the applicant, he was then knocked over and kicked by two police officers and a prison guard. During that time he also lost his gold neck chain. Subsequently, the applicant agreed to provide the samples.\n\nThe applicant claimed that as a result of the beating he had bruises on his abdomen, his back and his waist. He also had pain in his spine.\n\nOn 24 March 2003 the applicant filed a criminal complaint with the Che\u0142m District Prosecutor, alleging that he had been beaten on 13 March 2003 by two police officers and a prison guard. He further alleged that his gold chain had been stolen during the incident.\n\nOn 24 April 2003 the District Prosecutor opened an investigation. She heard the applicant and the two police officers and prison guard involved in the alleged incident. She also heard two other police officers who had been working in a neighbouring room at the time of the alleged incident.\n\nThe District Prosecutor established that the applicant had been told to provide the samples and, if he refused, that they would be taken against his will. After some persuasion, the applicant had agreed to provide the samples. All the officers confirmed that version of events and stated that force had not been used.\n\nThe District Prosecutor obtained other relevant evidence which did not corroborate the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment. Between 13 March and 1 April 2003 the applicant was seen by a prison doctor on five occasions. He did not report any injuries linked to his alleged ill-treatment and no such injuries were detected. On 27 March 2003 an ambulance was called for the applicant since he had complained about pain in his abdomen. On that occasion, the applicant did not mention any injuries related to his alleged ill-treatment and had received pain killers.\n\nAs regards the missing neck chain, the District Prosecutor found that at the time of his admission to the prison the applicant had not declared any valuables. Nor had he reported the loss of his neck chain to the prison administration.\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, on 30 June 2003 the District Prosecutor discontinued the investigation. She held that there was no evidence to support the view that the offences of assault and theft as alleged by the applicant had been committed.\n\nThe applicant appealed against that decision to the Lublin Regional Prosecutor. On an unspecified date the Regional Prosecutor upheld the decision of 30 June 2003 and transmitted the applicant's appeal to the Che\u0142m District Court for review.\n\nOn 20 October 2003 the Che\u0142m District Court upheld the decision of 30 June 2003.\n\nMeanwhile, on 12 September 2003 the Che\u0142m District Prosecutor had discontinued the investigation against the applicant concerning the charge of armed robbery. She held that the evidence obtained in the course of the investigation, including the samples of his body odour, did not confirm that the applicant had taken part in the armed robbery.\n\nB. The alleged censorship of the applicant's correspondence with the Court\n\nThe envelope in which the applicant sent his first letter from the Che\u0142m Prison to the Court dated 21 May 2003 bears the following stamps: \u201ccensored\u201d (ocenzurowano) and \u201cthe Che\u0142m District Court\u201d (S\u0105d Rejonowy w Che\u0142mie). It also bears a stamp confirming that the applicant's letter was received for dispatch by the prison administration on 23 May 2003. However, according to the postal stamp the letter was posted only on 3 June 2003. It also appears that the envelope had been cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape.\n\nThe envelope in which the applicant sent his application form from the Che\u0142m Prison to the Court dated 27 October 2003 bears the following stamps: \u201ccensored\u201d (ocenzurowano) and \u201cthe Che\u0142m District Court\u201d (S\u0105d Rejonowy w Che\u0142mie). It also bears a stamp confirming that the applicant's letter was received for dispatch by the prison administration on 3 November 2003. However, according to the postal stamp the letter was posted only on 13 November 2003. It also appears that the envelope had been cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 7436/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by three Turkish nationals, Mr \u0130smail \u015eencan, Ms H\u00fclya \u015eencan and Mr Nejdet \u015eencan (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 12 October 2001.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr F. Yurdakul, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 1 June 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1955, 1973 and 1962 respectively and live in Istanbul.\n\nThe applicants signed contracts with third persons before the notary public to acquire de facto possession (zilyedlik) of a plot of land in G\u00f6k\u00e7eada.\n\nOn 10 May 1990, 27 August 1991 and 18 May 1992 respectively, the applicants filed three separate actions with the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction and requested that their title to the plot in question be registered in the Land Registry records.\n\nOn 11 September 1991 and 16 March 1992 respectively the first\u2011instance court partially accepted the requests of the first and third applicants. Subsequently, on 28 April 1992 and 6 November 1992 respectively, the Court of Cassation quashed these judgments, holding that the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction had failed to carry out the necessary examination in order to determine the nature of the plot. The cases were remitted to the first-instance court.\n\nOn 12 October 1992 and 15 March 1993 the first-instance court once again partially accepted \u0130smail and Nejdet \u015eencan's claims. On 21 June 1993 the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction also partially accepted the second applicant's claim. In its judgments, the first-instance court held that the fact that the land in question appeared as \u201cmeadowland\u201d in the tax registration records did not mean that it could not be the subject of private ownership.\n\nOn 18 April 1994 the Court of Cassation quashed the three judgments of the first-instance court and held that the first-instance court should have taken into account the tax registration records and accepted the applicants' claims only in respect of the parts of the plot which were used for agriculture. It further held that meadowlands could not be subject to private ownership. The cases were remitted to the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction.\n\nOn 26 September 1994 all three cases were joined.\n\nOn 13 June 1995 the first-instance court again partially accepted the applicants' claims. In its judgment, the court stated that the plot in question was not designated as \u201cmeadowland\u201d in the land registration records and that, therefore, it could be subject to private ownership.\n\nOn 24 June 1996 the Court of Cassation once again quashed the judgment of the first-instance court, holding that according to the documents in the case-file, the plot in question was meadowland and that therefore the applicants could not have their title registered.\n\nOn 31 July 1996 the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and sent the case file to the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Cadastre Court.\n\nOn 5 June 1997 the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Cadastre Court rendered its judgment and partially accepted the applicants' claims.\n\nOn 20 May 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the cadastre court.\n\nOn 16 April 1999 the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Cadastre Court abided by the Court of Cassation's decision, holding that according to the tax registration records the land in question was meadowland and that it could not be subject to private ownership. The court further held that the land should be officially designated as a second degree conservation area.\n\nOn 21 March 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nOn 6 April 2001 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants' request for rectification. This decision was served on the applicants' representative on 30 April 2001."}

with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Mr Daniel Nowak and Mr Bogus\u0142aw Zaj\u0105czkowski (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 28 August 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 26 August 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1927 and 1938 respectively and live in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland.\n\n1. The facts prior to 1 May 1993\n\nOn 22 June 1992 the applicants sued the \u201cWroc\u0142awskie Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Rob\u00f3t In\u017cynieryjnych Budownictwa Przemys\u0142owego nr 2\u201d (\u201cthe defendant company\u201d) before the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court, seeking remuneration for the defendant company\u2019s use of an industrial invention of which they were the authors.\n\nThe Regional Court held 3 hearings on the following dates: 21 December 1992; 1 February and 2 April 1993.\n\n2. The facts after 1 May 1993\n\nThe Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court held 11 hearings on the following dates: 3 November and 22 December 1993; 29 January 1994; 20 February, 27 July and 23 November 1995; 30 January, 27 February, 10 July and 11 September 1997, and 21 December 1998.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings the Regional Court obtained five expert reports. It appears that two other experts (K.N. and R.B.) returned the case file after 5 months without having prepared a report as ordered by the court.\n\nThe applicant repeatedly complained to the President of the Regional Court and the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal about delays in the proceedings. On 6 February 1998 the President of the Regional Court and on 27 October 1998 the President of the Court of Appeal acknowledged that there had been delays.\n\nOn 30 June 1998 the applicants and the defendant company concluded an out-of-court settlement in respect of a minor part of the applicants\u2019 claims.\n\nOn 21 December 1998 the Regional Court gave judgment. It dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims and discontinued the proceedings in respect of the claims which had been the subject of the settlement. The applicants appealed against that judgment.\n\nOn 9 April 1999 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal held a hearing. On the same day it quashed the judgment of the Regional Court and remitted the case.\n\nThe Regional Court held 6 hearings on the following dates: 22 September, 13 October and 9 November 1999; 7 and 22 April and 1 December 2000. It obtained 3 additional expert reports.\n\nOn 15 December 2000 the Regional Court gave judgment. It allowed the applicants\u2019 claims in part. The defendant company appealed against that judgment. However, on 25 June 2001 it withdrew its appeal. Consequently, on 27 June 2001 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal discontinued the appeal proceedings.\n\nOn 12 July 2001 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal issued an enforcement order in favour of the applicants in respect of the judgment of the Regional Court of 15 December 2000.\n\nOn 22 November 2001 the defendant was declared insolvent.\n\nProceedings for compensation for damage suffered due to the excessive length of proceedings\n\nOn 10 November 2004 the applicants sued the State Treasury before the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court, seeking compensation for the excessive length of the proceedings referred to above.\n\nOn 10 February 2005 the first applicant (Mr Daniel Nowak) withdrew his claim. Consequently, on 28 February 2005 the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings in respect of the first applicant.\n\nOn 29 September 2005 the Regional Court gave judgment and dismissed the second applicant\u2019s claim. It found that he had failed to establish the State Treasury\u2019s liability for damage caused by the excessive length of the proceedings. The second applicant (Mr Bogus\u0142aw Zaj\u0105czkowski) appealed. The appeal proceedings are pending."}

under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by twelve Turkish nationals, Mr Ahmet G\u00fcven, Mr Ramazan Akda\u011f, Mr Kadri S\u00f6nmez, Mr Metin G\u00f6ktepe, Ms Neslihan G\u00f6ktepe, Mr \u0130zzettin Ko\u00e7, Mr Kadri Iss\u0131, Mr Mehmet K\u0131\u015fanak, Mr R\u0131dvan Karatay, Mr Ali Kemal Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Mr Ya\u015far Avc\u0131 and Ms Emsihan Karatay (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 30 October 2000.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr T. F\u0131rat, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 23 September 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1968, 1972, 1964, 1966, 1973, 1962, 1976, 1962, 1963, 1971, 1970 and 1969 respectively. They were detained in the Buca prison, in \u0130zmir, at the time of the events giving rise to the present application.\n\nA. Events in Buca Prison\n\nOn 20 July 1995 the applicants, along with ten other prisoners, were taken from their cells to an area of the prison in order to be brought before the \u0130zmir State Security Court for trial. According to the applicants, while they were waiting to be collected, they were attacked by prison administrators, prison warders and gendarmes using truncheons and wooden planks, because they had objected to being searched. According to the Government the applicants had resisted the search, attached themselves to one another and subsequently fallen down the stairs and injured themselves. The applicants were then taken to the \u0130zmir State Security Court in prison vehicles.\n\nAt the hearing before the State Security Court, the applicants' complained that they had been beaten before being brought before the court. The court noted the applicants' condition and decided to postpone the proceedings on the ground that it was impossible to hold a hearing in such circumstances. It ordered that the applicants be medically examined and that the results be sent to the \u0130zmir public prosecutor's office with a view to the opening of an investigation. A letter to that effect was sent the same day to the public prosecutor.\n\nB. The investigation concerning the incident in Buca prison\n\nA preliminary investigation was instigated by the \u0130zmir public prosecutor's office into the allegations of the applicants. On 20 July and 14 August 1995 the prosecutor took statements from the applicants who reiterated that they were beaten by the gendarmes and the prison wardens.\n\nOn 20 July 1995 a forensic expert examined Ahmet G\u00fcven, Kadri S\u00f6nmez, Metin G\u00f6ktepe, Neslihan G\u00f6ktepe, \u0130zzettin Ko\u00e7, Kadir Iss\u0131, Mehmet K\u0131\u015fanak, R\u0131dvan Karatay, Ali Kemal Y\u0131ld\u0131z and Ms Emsihan Karatay in prison.\n\nIn his report, the doctor noted that Emsihan Karatay complained of a pain in her head and her left leg. The doctor decided that the applicant be referred to the orthopaedist at the Izmir State Hospital.\n\nAs regards Neslihan G\u00f6ktepe, he observed that there were swellings on her head, behind her left ear and an erythema on her back as a result of blows. He also noted a graze on her neck. The doctor concluded that Neslihan G\u00f6ktepe should be re-examined by a forensic expert at the Izmir Forensic Medicine Institute in seven days.\n\nIn respect of Kadri Iss\u0131, the doctor noted erythemas on the upper left part of his back and on his left arm. He further observed a wound and haemorrhage under his left ear. Kadri Iss\u0131 further complained of pain in the lower right part of his back. The doctor considered that the injuries rendered the applicant unfit for work for fifteen days.\n\nAs to \u0130zzettin Ko\u00e7, the medical report referred to wounds over his eyebrows and nose and several ecchymoses, erythemas and grazes on his back and his left knee which had been caused by blows. The doctor concluded that the injuries rendered \u0130zzettin Ko\u00e7 unfit for work for ten days and that he would recover within twenty days following a medical treatment.\n\nAs regards Mehmet K\u0131\u015fanak, the doctor observed swellings and erythemas on the upper part of the back, underneath the chin and around the nose and mouth as a result of blows. He further noted an erythema on the applicant's right leg. The doctor concluded that the injuries rendered Mehmet K\u0131\u015fanak unfit for work for ten days and that he would recover within twenty days following a medical treatment.\n\nAs regards R\u0131dvan Karatay, the medical report referred to an erythema and a swelling on the right eye orbit, erythemas and ecchymoses on the upper part of the back as a result of blows. The applicant further complained of pain in his head. The doctor decided that R\u0131dvan Karatay should be referred to the ophthalmologist at the Izmir State Hospital.\n\nWith regard to Kadri S\u00f6nmez, the forensic expert noted erythemas and swellings on the upper part of his back, on both his arms and his right ear. The applicant also complained of pain in his left leg. The doctor observed that the injuries rendered the applicant unfit for work for five days.\n\nAs to Ali Kemal Y\u0131ld\u0131z, the report referred to swellings and erythemas on the applicant's back, neck, and head and to an ecchymosis behind his ear as a result of blows. There were also erythemas on the applicant's left arm and left leg. The doctor further noted that the applicant complained of pain in his head and his chin. He concluded that the injuries rendered him unfit for work for seven days and considered that he would recover within five days.\n\nAs regards Metin G\u00f6ktepe, the doctor observed swellings, erythemas and ecchymoses behind the applicant's head, on his chin, back, neck and arms as a result of blows. The forensic expert concluded that the injuries rendered him unfit for work for ten days and considered that he would recover within twenty days following medical treatment.\n\nFinally, as regards Ahmet G\u00fcven, the medical report referred to pain in the applicant's head, wounds on the right eye orbit and around the eyebrows, to swellings and pain in his right arm and to ecchymoses and grazes on his back and around his ribs. The doctor decided that the applicant be referred to the orthopaedist at the Izmir State Hospital.\n\nOn 18 August 1995 an expert from the Forensic Medicine Institute examined Ramazan Akda\u011f and sent the medical report to the Izmir public prosecutor's office. According to this report this applicant sustained the following injuries: haemorrhage on the right sclera, swelling of 4 x 4 cm on the post-parietal bone on the scalp, erythemas on the forehead, swellings and ecchymoses on the zygomas, the orbits and the left ear, swelling and a scar on the lower lip, a trauma on the left clavicle, ecchymosis of 10 cm in diameter on the left hemithorax and ecchymotic lesions on the right hemithorax. The forensic expert considered that the injuries were not life threatening but rendered him unfit for work for seven days and that he would recover within twenty days.\n\nOn 17 November 1995 a doctor from the Forensic Medicine Institute reported that Ya\u015far Avc\u0131, who was hospitalised on 20 July 1995 with the diagnosis of \u201cgeneral body trauma\u201d, had sustained the following injuries at the time of the hospitalisation: ecchymoses on the back and on both shoulders, a graze of 2 x 2 cm on the right zygoma, erythemas in the forehead, sensitivity on the left tibia. The doctor considered that the applicant should wear a cervical collar. According to the report of 17 November 1995 the applicant was discharged from the hospital on 28 July 1995 and was re\u2011examined on 9 October 1995. The expert concluded that the injuries had not been life threatening but had rendered him unfit for work for ten days and that he would recover.\n\nOn 9 April 1996 the prosecutor decided not to prosecute the Director of Buca Prison and his staff for alleged ill-treatment of the applicants. The applicants objected to this decision. On 25 June 1996 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court dismissed the applicants' objection.\n\nOn 11 April 1996 the prosecutor transferred the investigation file concerning the gendarmes to the \u0130zmir Administrative Council. However, the case file subsequently went astray after it was sent to the Divisional Gendarme Command at Buca Prison.\n\nOn 1 May 2000 \u0130zmir Administrative Council decided to open an investigation against three gendarme officials in connection with the disappearance of the above-mentioned case file. It however decided not to bring proceedings against the gendarmes responsible for the transfer of the applicants to court on 20 July 1995.\n\nThe Government informed the Court that the proceedings against the gendarmes who had lost the file were terminated by a decision of non\u2011prosecution on 15 January 2002 on account of the expiry of the statutory time-limit.\n\nThe applicants claimed that they were never informed of the outcome of the proceedings and that they learned of the decision of the \u0130zmir Administrative Council when the Court delivered its judgment in the case of Sat\u0131k and Others (no. 31866/96, 10 October 2000) which had been lodged by ten other prisoners who had been injured on 20 July 1995 in Buca prison.\n\nC. The detention conditions of Ahmet G\u00fcven\n\nThe applicant was convicted of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of a part of the national territory under Article 125 of the Criminal Code and sentenced to death on 2 December 1998. This judgment became final on 17 April 2000 after the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. On 6 September 2002 the applicant's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the \u0130zmir Assize Court.\n\nIt appears from the case-file that the applicant took part in hunger strikes on various occasions and that as a result his health deteriorated.\n\nAccording to the medical report issued by Bitlis State Hospital on 26 June 2003 the applicant suffered from hypertension, anxiety and slight amnesia. On 15 July 2003 the Bitlis State Hospital Medical Commission issued an additional report in which it concluded that the medical condition of the applicant did not necessitate the suspension of his sentence.\n\nOn 28 July 2003 the applicant requested the suspension of his sentence pursuant to Article 399 of the Criminal Code on Procedure. On 17 July 2003 the Bitlis public prosecutor, relying on the aforementioned reports of the Bitlis State Hospital, dismissed the applicant's request. No document has been submitted by the parties as to whether the applicant objected to this decision.\n\nAccording to a medical report issued by Bitlis State Hospital on 24 June 2004 the applicant suffered from hypertension, depression, vertigo (light-headedness) and head pains. The applicant was prescribed medication as well as a special diet. Following this report the prison authorities decided that the applicant be given a special diet.\n\nAccording to a medical report issued by two doctors, Mr U.O. and Mr N.S., on 1 November 2005, the applicant was diagnosed in 2003 as suffering from hypertension and amnesia. They noted that he was receiving drug treatment and that he could physically continue to take care of himself within a prison facility.\n\nThe Government submitted a number of documents as regards the applicant's transfer to various medical centres for check-up and the results of his analyses."}

against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by eleven Turkish nationals, Mr \u015eeyho Saya, Mr Hasan \u00d6lg\u00fcn, Mr \u00c7etin Ta\u015f, Mr M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Atasoy, Ms Z\u00f6hre Ta\u015f, Mr Ak\u0131n Do\u011fan, Mr Nedim \u00c7if\u00e7i, Ms Hediye Kilin\u00e7, Mr Ali Murat Bilgi\u00e7, Mr Bahattin Bar\u0131\u015f Bilgi\u00e7 and Ms Zeynep Saya (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 20 November 2001.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr \u015eeyho Saya, the first applicant, who is a lawyer practising in Ad\u0131yaman. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 September 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1964, 1969, 1964, 1971, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1975, 1964, 1971 and 1965 respectively, and live in Ad\u0131yaman.\n\nOn 30 April 1999 the Ad\u0131yaman Governor authorised the holding of May Day celebrations in the Ad\u0131yaman Amphitheatre, located in the Hasanc\u0131k District.\n\nOn 1 May 1999 a group of people, including the applicants, gathered in the building of the Health Workers\u2019 Trade Union and started to walk towards the amphitheatre for the May Day celebrations. They were stopped by police officers. Stating that they had obtained prior authorisation from the Governor, the group attempted to continue its march. The police then intervened to disperse the group; the applicants were allegedly injured during this incident as a result of the force used by the police. According to the incident report, thirty-eight people, including the applicants, were arrested. The applicants were subsequently taken to the Ad\u0131yaman State Hospital, where they were examined by a doctor. The medical reports in respect of Ms Zeynep Saya, Mr Hasan \u00d6lg\u00fcn, Mr M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Atasoy, Ms Z\u00f6hre Ta\u015f, Mr Nedim \u00c7if\u00e7i and Ms Hediye Kilin\u00e7 stated that there were no signs of ill-treatment on their bodies. As regards the remaining applicants, the following findings were indicated in the respective medical reports: \u2013 \u015eeyho Saya: Tenderness on the back of the right leg and on the back. \u2013 \u00c7etin Ta\u015f: Tenderness on the lower left side of the chest and pain while breathing. Tenderness and pain on the right side of the forehead. Possible fracture of the ribs on the left side of the chest. \u2013 Ak\u0131n Do\u011fan: Scratches on the back. \u2013 Ali Murat Bilgi\u00e7: Tenderness and bruises on the left shoulder and the left arm. \u2013 Bahattin Bar\u0131\u015f Bilgi\u00e7: Scratches on the right elbow, the right knee and hyperaemia on the left side of the chest.\n\nThe applicants were then taken into custody. They were released the next day.\n\nOn different dates in May 1999 the applicants filed criminal complaints with the Ad\u0131yaman Public Prosecutor against those police officers who had allegedly used excessive force during their arrest.\n\nOn 17 June 1999 the Ad\u0131yaman Public Prosecutor transferred the case file to the Ad\u0131yaman Provincial Administrative Council, seeking authorisation to bring criminal proceedings against the accused officers, pursuant to the provisions of Law on the prosecution of Civil Servants.\n\nOn 16 February 2000 the Ad\u0131yaman Provincial Administrative Council found that there was not enough evidence to initiate criminal proceedings against the accused officers and consequently refused to do so. On 1 September 2000 the applicants appealed against this decision. In their appeal petition, they invoked a breach of Article 11 of the Convention, arguing that the police interference had breached their freedom of assembly. On 14 June 2001 the Supreme Administrative Council upheld the decision of the Administrative Council.\n\nIn the meantime, on 1 June 1999 the Ad\u0131yaman Public Prosecutor, after examining a video recording of the incident, delivered a decision not to prosecute with regard to seventy demonstrators \u2013 including the applicants \u2013 who had been involved in the incident on 1 May 1999. In reaching his decision, the Public Prosecutor stated that the demonstrators had been stopped by the police, although they had been walking silently along the pavement, without presenting a danger to the public or engaging in any violent activities. It was also indicated in the decision that, pursuant to section 24 of the Assemblies and Marches Act (Law no. 2911), the police were under an obligation to warn the group out loud to disperse; however, it was observed from the recording of the incident that they had failed to do so. In consequence, the public prosecutor held that the accused had not violated Law no. 2911."}

by the Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) on 17 August 1998 and by a Polish national, Mr Zbigniew Musia\u0142 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 7 August 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 \u00a7 1 and 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 24557/94) against the Republic of Poland lodged by Mr Musia\u0142 with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 on 10 January 1994. The Government\u2019s application referred to former Articles 44 and 48, and that of the applicant to former Article 48, as amended by Protocol No. 91, which Poland had ratified. The object of the applications was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n\nOn 7 October 1998 Mr R. Bernhardt, the President of the Court at the time, declined the applicant\u2019s request for leave to present his own case before the Court. The applicant designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 31 of former Rules of Court B2). The lawyer was given leave by the President to use the Polish language (former Rule 28 \u00a7 3).\n\nAs President of the Chamber which had originally been constituted (former Article 43 of the Convention and former Rule 21) in order to deal, in particular, with procedural matters that might arise before the entry into force of Protocol No. 11, Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant\u2019s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the written procedure. Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government\u2019s and the applicant\u2019s memorials on 30 November 1998. On 8 December 1998 the Secretary to the Commission sent the Delegate\u2019s observations to the Registry.\n\nAfter the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 5 thereof, the case was referred to the Grand Chamber of the Court. The Grand Chamber included ex officio Mr J. Makarczyk, the judge elected in respect of Poland (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 24 \u00a7 4 of the Rules of the Court), Mr L. Wildhaber, the President of the Court, Mrs E. Palm and Mr C.L. Rozakis, the Vice-Presidents of the Court, and Sir Nicolas Bratza and Mr M. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4, Presidents of Sections (Article 27 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and Rule 24 \u00a7 3). The other members appointed to complete the Grand Chamber were Mr B. Conforti, Mr A. Pastor Ridruejo, Mr G. Bonello, Mr P. K\u016bris, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1, Mr V. Butkevych, Mr J. Casadevall, Mrs H.S. Greve, Mr R. Maruste and Mrs S. Botoucharova (Rule 24 \u00a7 3 and Rule 100 \u00a7 4). Subsequently Mr M. Fischbach replaced Mr Rozakis, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 \u00a7 5 (a)).\n\nAt the Court\u2019s invitation (Rule 99), the Commission delegated one of its members, Mr M.A. Nowicki, to take part in the proceedings before the Grand Chamber.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, a hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 16 December 1998. There appeared before the Court:\n\n(a) for the Government\n\nMr K. Drzewicki, Professor of Public International Law, Agent, Mrs M. W\u0105sek-Wiaderek, Mrs E. Cha\u0142ubi\u0144ska, Mr K. Karpi\u0144ski, Advisers;\n\n(b) for the applicant\n\nMr H. Stabla, of the Katowice Bar, Counsel;\n\n(c) for the Commission\n\nMr M.A. Nowicki Delegate. The Court heard addresses by Mr Nowicki, Mr Stabla, Mr Drzewicki and Mrs W\u0105sek-Wiaderek, and also their replies to its questions.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. the circumstances of the case\n\nThe applicant was born in 1953. He lives in Stalowa Wola, Poland.\n\nIn 1986 the Katowice regional prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of manslaughter of his wife. On 18 October 1987 the applicant was examined by a medical panel composed of two psychiatrists, who found that, on health grounds, he could not be held criminally responsible. The panel further concluded that the applicant posed a threat to public order. On 31 October 1987 the Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j district prosecutor, having regard to the medical opinion, decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant. On 30 November 1987 the Jastrz\u0119bie-Zdr\u00f3j district prosecutor requested the Katowice Regional Court to order the applicant\u2019s committal to a psychiatric institution.\n\nOn 8 February 1988 the Katowice Regional Court committed the applicant to a mental hospital. The court, taking into consideration the submission of the prosecutor that the applicant had killed his wife and the expert medical opinion of 18 October 1987, concluded that the applicant posed a threat to public order. On 18 March 1988 the Supreme Court upheld this decision. On 13 April 1988 the applicant was placed in Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital.\n\nOn 4 November 1988, 15 September 1989, 13 November 1989, 12 March 1990, 9 July 1990 and 17 December 1990 the Katowice Regional Court gave decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The court had regard to the applicant\u2019s medical file, including opinions of psychiatrists from Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital, which indicated that in view of the applicant\u2019s condition, which remained unchanged, his continued detention was necessary as he still presented a threat to public order.\n\nOn 4 April 1991 the applicant\u2019s officially appointed lawyer requested the latter\u2019s release from the psychiatric hospital. On 27 May 1991 the Katowice Regional Court again refused to order the applicant\u2019s release, finding that it would entail a threat to public order.\n\nIn a further medical opinion of 27 December 1991 the Rybnik Hospital psychiatrists stated that the applicant\u2019s condition required his continued detention and in its subsequent decision the Katowice Regional Court again refused to order his release.\n\nOn 10 January 1992 the Minister of Justice refused leave for an extraordinary appeal against the decision of 8 February 1988 concerning the applicant\u2019s committal to a psychiatric institution.\n\nOn 22 June 1992 the court, having considered the opinion of psychiatrists, again refused to order the applicant\u2019s release.\n\nOn 16 March 1993 the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged a further request for the applicant\u2019s release with the Katowice Regional Court. He also insisted that psychiatrists from Cracow University examine the applicant as he was convinced that it was only from this institution that an unbiased opinion could be obtained. By letters of 25 March 1993 and 13 April 1993, the court ordered Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital to submit an up-to-date medical opinion on the applicant\u2019s condition.\n\nIn their opinion of 19 April 1993, the Rybnik Hospital psychiatrists stated that the applicant\u2019s condition required his continued detention and suggested that in view of his repeated requests for a medical examination by psychiatrists from another institution it would be advisable to order such an examination. By a decision of 26 April 1993, the court ordered that the applicant\u2019s condition should be assessed by psychiatrists from Cracow University.\n\nOn 5 May 1993 the court found that the applicant could undergo the necessary medical examination in the Psychiatric Department of Cracow Detention Centre. On 17 May 1993 it fixed the date of the applicant\u2019s admission to the Centre at 31 May 1993. The applicant was brought to the Centre on that date, but was not admitted since certain necessary documents had not been submitted to the Centre. The Centre informed the court that the applicant could only be admitted on the strength of an order for his detention on remand and that persons detained at the Centre were subject to the legal provisions governing detention on remand.\n\nIn a letter of 31 May 1993, the applicant complained to the court that he had not been examined by the Psychiatric Department of Cracow University. He contended that any opinion prepared by psychiatrists of the Cracow Detention Centre would be biased and threatened to go on hunger strike if he was brought to the Centre for a medical examination.\n\nOn 25 June 1993 the applicant requested the reopening of the criminal proceedings.\n\nOn 4 August 1993 the Psychiatric Department of Cracow University informed the Katowice Regional Court that the exact date of the applicant\u2019s out-patient examination could be fixed only after 23 August 1993. By a letter of 18 August 1993, the Katowice Regional Court forwarded that information to the applicant.\n\nOn 1 and 2 September 1993 Cracow University informed the court that the applicant could be admitted to the University hospital in late October or early November 1993, after an analysis of his medical file had been completed.\n\nBy a letter of 15 September 1993, the Katowice regional prosecutor informed the applicant that his request of 23 June 1993 to have the criminal proceedings reopened would not be considered.\n\nOn 22 September 1993 the applicant\u2019s medical file was sent to Cracow University. On 18 November 1993 the applicant requested the court to order his examination without further delay. On 17 December 1993, the University, in reply to the court\u2019s enquiry, informed it that the applicant would be admitted for an out-patient examination from 31 January to 3 February 1994. On 24 January 1994 the court informed the applicant that his file had been transmitted to the Psychiatric Department of Cracow University.\n\nFrom 31 January to 4 February 1994 the applicant underwent an examination at the Psychiatric Department of Cracow University.\n\nOn 18 May 1994 the Katowice Regional Court informed the applicant that his file was still with the Psychiatric Department of the University and that the expert medical report was not yet ready. On 30 May 1994, the University informed the court that the opinion would be ready by the end of June 1994.\n\nOn 16 June 1994 the applicant requested access to his medical file. On 21 June 1994 the court informed him that it was still at Cracow University.\n\nOn 21 June 1994, in reply to the court\u2019s enquiry, the University informed the Katowice Regional Court that it could not return the applicant\u2019s medical file to the court, as the medical opinion had not been prepared. On 5 July 1994, the applicant again requested to be granted access to his medical file. On 21 July 1994 the Katowice Regional Court informed him that his file was still being examined by the specialists of the Cracow University Psychiatric Department, who were preparing an opinion.\n\nIn their opinion of 30 November 1994, the psychiatrists from Cracow University stated that the applicant\u2019s condition required continued detention and that the grounds on which his committal to a psychiatric institution had been ordered had not ceased to exist. This opinion was submitted to the Katowice Regional Court on 15 December 1994.\n\nOn 9 January 1995 the court, having considered the medical opinion of 30 November 1994, decided that the applicant\u2019s detention should be maintained.\n\nSubsequently, by decisions of 4 March 1996 and 30 December 1996, the Katowice Regional Court ordered that, in the light of medical opinions of 18 January 1996 and 24 September 1996 respectively, the applicant should remain in detention. On 28 September 1996, the applicant attempted to commit suicide at Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital. On 23 June 1997, the Katowice Regional Court ordered the applicant\u2019s release."}

"text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38114/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet Zeki Do\u011fan (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 13 November 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M.A. K\u0131rd\u00f6k and Mrs M. K\u0131rd\u00f6k, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 May 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the use of the applicant's statements allegedly taken under duress by the Istanbul State Security Court and the lack of legal assistance to the applicant during his police custody. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1978 and is serving his prison sentence in the Edirne prison.\n\nOn 13 March 1998 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. On 15 March 1998 his statement was taken by the police and on 20 March 1998 he was released due to lack of evidence.\n\nOn 7 May 1998 the applicant was arrested once again on suspicion of injuring a third person and collecting money by force from third persons on behalf of an illegal organisation. On 12 May 1998 the applicant was interrogated by the police in the absence of a lawyer. On 14 May 1998 he was taken for a medical examination. The medical report stated that there was no trace of ill-treatment on his body. On the same day, the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge. Before both officials, the applicant retracted his police statement, alleging that he had been forced to sign it. After the questioning was over, the investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody. On 25 May 1998 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment, charging the applicant under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code with attempting to undermine the constitutional order. On 13 December 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant of being a member of an illegal organisation and sentenced him to fifteen years, seven months and fifteen days' imprisonment, pursuant to Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the former Criminal Code. In convicting the applicant, the first instance court relied, inter alia, on the police statement of the applicant.\n\nOn 8 July 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court, holding that the applicant should have been convicted under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code. After re-examining the case file, on 12 November 2002 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On 5 May 2003 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant's appeal. On 2 June 2003 the decision of the Court of Cassation was deposited with the Registry of the Istanbul State Security Court."}

32705/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Hikmettin Att\u0131 and Mr Nevzat Tedik (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 15 October 1999.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr Mesut Be\u015fta\u015f and Ms Meral Be\u015fta\u015f, lawyers practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicants alleged, in particular, that they had not been informed of the reasons for their arrest, that they had not been brought before a judge within a reasonable time, that their families had not been informed about their arrests and that they had not had the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of their detention in police custody. They also alleged that the criminal proceedings against them had not been conducted fairly.\n\nOn 2 October 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the applicants' right to be informed promptly of the reasons for their arrest, their right to be brought promptly before a judge following their arrest, their right to take proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of their detention in police custody, their right to a fair trial, their right to legal assistance and their right to respect for their family life to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1979 and 1975 respectively and live in Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nOn 31 May 1999 the applicants were arrested at different locations in Diyarbak\u0131r. It appears from the arrest report in respect of Mr Att\u0131 that he was arrested outside the university where he was a student. The reason for the arrest was the police officers' \u201csuspicion of his appearance/condition\u201d (durumundan \u015f\u00fcphe etti\u011fimiz). He was taken into police custody for the \u201cnecessary investigation to be carried out\u201d.\n\nAccording to the arrest report in respect of Mr Tedik, he was arrested in a house and \u201cin relation to an investigation\u201d. Mr Tedik was also taken to the police station. The police officers who arrested Mr Tedik also searched the house and found a number of books and magazines in the Kurdish and Turkish languages. The books included a book of poems, a novel and a Kurdish grammar book.\n\nThe Diyarbak\u0131r Police Headquarters, where the applicants were being detained, wrote to the prosecutor's office at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court on 2 and 4 June 1999, and asked for permission to detain the applicants for a number of additional days. On 4 June 1999 the prosecutor granted permission to the police to detain the applicants until 10 June 1999.\n\nAlso on 4 June 1999 a number of police officers took the applicants to a number of locations where, the applicants claimed in two signed statements prepared the same day, they had carried out a number of activities on behalf of the PKK0, including preparing and throwing Molotov cocktails.\n\nThe applicants were questioned by police officers on 8 June 1999. They stated that they were PKK sympathisers and also members of the Patriotic Youth Union (Yurtsever Gen\u00e7lik Birli\u011fi).\n\nOn 9 June 1999 the applicants were released from police custody and brought before the prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court, who took statements from them. In their statements the applicants denied any connections with the PKK, and submitted that they had been forced to sign their police custody statements without having been allowed to read them first. The same day the applicants were brought before the duty judge, who remanded them in custody pending the introduction of criminal proceedings against them.\n\nWhen questioned by police officers and subsequently by the prosecutor and the judge, the applicants were not represented by a lawyer.\n\nOn 14 June 1999 the prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicants and ten other persons with the offence of membership of an illegal organisation, an offence defined in Article 168 of the Criminal Code which was in force at the time.\n\nThe first hearing in the case was held on 22 June 1999 by the First Division of the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court. In the course of the trial, the applicants were represented by lawyers, and they repeatedly denied the accuracy of the contents of their police custody statements.\n\nOn 13 March 2001 the applicants were found guilty as charged and sentenced to twelve and a half years' imprisonment. In convicting the applicants the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court relied on the statements taken from them in police custody.\n\nThe prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written observations to that court but they were not forwarded to the applicants or their lawyers. The applicants' convictions were upheld by the Court of Cassation on 11 October 2001."}

(\u201cthe Commission\u201c) and on 27 January 1989 by the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (\u201cthe Government\u201c), within the period of three months laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 11855/85) against Sweden lodged with the Commission in 1984 by Mr G\u00f6sta H\u00e5kansson and Mr Sune Sturesson, both Swedish citizens, under Article 25 (art. 25). The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request and of the Government\u2019s application was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6, 13 and 14 (art. 6, art. 13, art. 14) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).\n\nIn response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent them (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 26 January 1989 the President of the Court drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr B. Walsh, Mr R. Bernhardt and Mr S. K. Martens (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr C. Russo, substitute judge, replaced Mr Martens, who was unable to attend (Rule 22 para. 1 and Rule 24 para. 1).\n\nMr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5). He ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicants regarding the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 para. 1). Thereafter, in accordance with the President\u2019s Order, the registry received the memorials of the Government and of the applicants on 31 July and 4 August 1989, respectively; in a letter of 5 September, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not wish to file a memorial.\n\nHaving consulted, through the Registrar, those who would be appearing before the Court, the President directed on 29 June 1989 that the oral proceedings should open on 25 September 1989 (Rule 38). On 22 September the Commission produced various documents requested by the Registrar upon instructions from the President of the Court.\n\nThe hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately prior to its opening, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr H. Corell, Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Agent, Mr R. Str\u00f6mberg, Permanent Under-Secretary and Chief Legal Officer, Ministry of Environment and Energy, Mr L. Lindstr\u00f6m, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Justice, Mr P. Boqvist, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr C. L. Rozakis, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicants Mr G. Ravnsborg, Lecturer in Law at the Counsel, University of Lund. The Court heard addresses by Mr Corell for the Government, by Mr Rozakis for the Commission and by Mr Ravnsborg for the applicants, as well as the Government\u2019s replies to its questions. The applicants\u2019 replies were received at the registry on 20 October 1989 and the Government\u2019s comments thereon on 20 November 1989. On 4 December 1989 the President rejected an application from the Government to file additional evidence and on 23 January 1990 the Chamber rejected a similar application from the applicant (Rule 40 para. 1).\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. The 1979 compulsory auction\n\nMr G\u00f6sta H\u00e5kansson is resident at H\u00f6\u00f6r and a police officer by profession, and Mr Sune Sturesson is resident at Sk\u00e5nes Fagerhult and a farmer by profession.\n\nOn 4 December 1979 the applicants bought for 240,000 Swedish crowns (SEK) at a compulsory sale by auction (exekutiv auktion; \u201cthe 1979 auction\u201c) an agricultural estate called Risb\u00f6ke 1:3 in the municipality of Markaryd. Their main competitors at the auction, Mr Bertil Bjarnhagen and Mr Michael Borg, bid 235,000 and 220,000 SEK, respectively. The property had been seized in July 1979 in order to secure the payment of the previous owners\u2019 debts to three banks. According to a valuation made public before the auction, the market value (saluv\u00e4rde) of the property was estimated at 140,000 SEK.\n\nAt the auction the public was, according to the minutes drafted by the representative of the County Administrative Board (l\u00e4nsstyrelsen) of the County of Kronoberg, informed of the regulations contained in section 2, sub-section 10, and section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act 1979 (jordf\u00f6rv\u00e4rvslagen 1979:230; \u201cthe 1979 Act\u201c), whereby a purchaser would have to resell the property within two years unless he had obtained in the meantime from the County Agricultural Board (lantbruksn\u00e4mnden) of the same County a permit to retain it or fell under one of the listed exceptions from the permit requirement (see paragraphs 28 and 32 below). The applicants maintained that a representative of the County Administrative Board had stated, at the public viewing of the property on 27 November 1979, that, in this case, the requisite permit would certainly be granted speedily; they further claimed that this had been confirmed by the County Administrative Board at the auction. In support of these allegations, the applicants submitted three affidavits, each of which was signed in 1989 by a person who had been present either at the auction or at the public viewing.\n\nB. The applications for a permit to retain the estate\n\nOn 7 January 1980 the County Administrative Board drew up a sale contract (k\u00f6pebrev) in which the applicants were reminded of the wording of section 16 para. 1 of the 1979 Act. On the same day the applicants submitted a request to the County Agricultural Board for a permit to retain the estate Risb\u00f6ke 1:3.\n\nBy letter of 5 February 1980, the County Agricultural Board informed the applicants that the estate had, in view of its size, situation and nature, to be considered as a \u201crationalisation unit\u201c (rationaliseringsfastighet) which ought to be used for the purpose of consolidating other properties in the area that were capable of further development. It added that, as neighbours were interested in acquiring the property, the request might be refused under section 4 para. 1, sub-section 3, of the 1979 Act (see paragraph 30 below). The County Agricultural Board also indicated that there were reasons to believe that the price paid was too high for redemption (inl\u00f6sen - see paragraph 34 below). On 15 February 1980 the County Agricultural Board rejected the applicants\u2019 request on the ground that the estate was a \u201crationalisation unit\u201c.\n\nThe applicants appealed to the National Board of Agriculture (lantbruksstyrelsen), which rejected the appeal on 5 September 1980. In its decision the National Board of Agriculture noted the following. Risb\u00f6ke 1:3 had an area of 41 hectares of which 18 hectares were forest and 8 hectares pasture. There were no buildings on the property. Mr Sturesson\u2019s estate, which comprised 63 hectares of forest and 10 of pasture, was 25 kilometres away. Through their purchase the applicants had intended to build up units which would, in the short run, create opportunities for employment and, in the long run, become financially sound properties to be exploited by their children. The Board noted however that in the opinion of the County Agricultural Board, there was only room for one active farmer in the region. Finally, Mr Michael Borg, who leased two neighbouring properties, one of which was owned by his father, had shown a great interest in acquiring the applicants\u2019 property. The Board concluded: \u201cThe National Board of Agriculture finds, as did the County Agricultural Board, that the real estate at issue lacks the prerequisites for remaining as a separate cultivation unit. Moreover, the National Board considers that a new establishment on the property would be likely to make it more difficult for the active farmer in the area to develop his business.\u201c\n\nThe applicants appealed to the Government (Ministry of Agriculture), which rejected the appeal on 26 February 1981.\n\nA new request, dated 4 January 1982, for a permit to retain Risb\u00f6ke 1:3 was rejected by the County Agricultural Board on 25 January 1982. The Board stated that the estate was considered to be a unit suitable for rationalisation purposes, which ought to be used to consolidate properties within the area that were capable of further development. It furthermore stated that it was not prepared to redeem the estate at the price of 240,000 SEK.\n\nThe applicants appealed to the National Board of Agriculture. After inspecting the property, it rejected the appeal on 15 November 1982, on the ground that there were no new circumstances justifying a departure from its previous decision.\n\nThe applicants\u2019 further appeal to the Government was dismissed on 27 October 1983.\n\nIn a letter of 11 January 1985 the applicants requested the Government to reconsider their decision of 27 October 1983. The Government, recalling that the case had been finally settled by them on the latter date, decided on 14 March 1985 not to take any further action in respect of the request.\n\nC. The redemption proceedings\n\nThe applicants brought proceedings before the Real Estate Court (fastighetsdomstolen) of V\u00e4xj\u00f6 requesting that the State redeem the Risb\u00f6ke 1:3 in accordance with section 14 of the 1979 Act (see paragraph 34 below). In a judgment of 11 December 1981 the court rejected the claim, stating that in view of the clear wording of section 14 this provision could not be applied by analogy to the applicants\u2019 situation. The applicants appealed to the G\u00f6ta Court of Appeal (G\u00f6ta hovr\u00e4tt), which on 1 July 1982 confirmed the judgment of the Real Estate Court. On 14 July 1983 the Supreme Court (h\u00f6gsta domstolen) refused leave to appeal.\n\nD. The 1985 compulsory resale by auction\n\nAt the request of the County Agricultural Board, the County Administrative Board ordered, on 10 November 1983, the compulsory resale by auction of Risb\u00f6ke 1:3 in accordance with the provisions of sections 16 and 17 of the 1979 Act (see paragraphs 36-38 below). The Enforcement Office (kronofogdemyndigheten) in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 was responsible for arranging the auction.\n\nIn February and March 1984 the National Board of Forestry (skogsv\u00e5rdsstyrelsen) assessed the value of the property in accordance with the price-control regulations (that is, in principle, by reference to its yield) at 100,000 SEK and its market value as not exceeding 200,000 SEK. In April 1984 the Senior Land Surveyor (\u00f6verlantm\u00e4taren) of the County of Kronoberg made a new valuation of the property, resulting in an estimated market value of 125,000 SEK.\n\nOn 19 April 1984 the Enforcement Office determined that the estate had a value of 125,000 SEK. The applicants challenged this before the G\u00f6ta Court of Appeal but the court dismissed the action on 4 June 1984, stating that it was not possible to appeal against such a determination as it was only a preparatory step for a subsequent decision on the sale of the estate (see paragraph 39 below). The applicants appealed against this decision to the Supreme Court, which on 23 August 1984 refused leave to appeal. On 26 June 1984, at the applicants\u2019 request, the County Administrative Board appointed two special valuers (see paragraph 37 below). In their report of October 1984, the valuers concluded that the property had an estimated market value of 172,000 SEK, taking into account certain expenditure deemed necessary for thinning out trees (mainly Christmas trees) that had been newly planted by the applicants.\n\nThe auction took place on 18 June 1985 (\u201cthe 1985 auction\u201c). The Enforcement Office noted that the estate had an estimated market value of 172,000 SEK and a taxable value of 107,000 SEK. It decided that the lowest bid which could be accepted would be 172,000 SEK. At the auction, there was, in fact, only one bid. It was an offer of 172,000 SEK made by the County Agricultural Board and it was accepted by the Enforcement Office. After the costs of the valuation and the auction had been deducted the applicants received 155,486.50 SEK.\n\nPrior to the auction in June 1985, five requests for advance permits (f\u00f6rhandstillst\u00e5nd) to acquire the property had been filed with the County Agricultural Board (see paragraph 36 below). On 10 April 1984 the Board granted the request filed by Mr Michael Borg and Mr Thorwald Borg on condition that they applied, within two months from the public auction, for a merger of Risb\u00f6ke 1:3 and the two neighbouring properties which they now owned (cf. paragraph 12 above). The other requests were rejected by the Board on 10 and 14 June 1985.\n\nOn 19 June 1985 the applicants appealed to the G\u00f6ta Court of Appeal requesting that the compulsory sale be annulled. They argued that the property had not been sold at the market price, as required by law, since the valuation which had arrived at the figure of 172,000 SEK had been based only on an assessment of the yield from the property. The applicants stated that they intended to submit to the court a new valuation report. However, on 3 July 1985 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.\n\nThe applicants filed a further appeal with the Supreme Court, in which they also challenged the impartiality of the two special valuers on the ground that they had had a duty, under section 6 of the Land Acquisition Ordinance 1979 (see paragraph 37 below), to consult with the County Agricultural Board - which had in the event been the buyer of the estate - when making their valuation. They did not raise any complaint in respect of the absence of any public hearing before the Court of Appeal. On 20 August 1985 the Supreme Court refused to grant leave to appeal.\n\nOn 17 December 1985 the County Agricultural Board sold the property to Mr Michael Borg and Mr Thorwald Borg for 125,000 SEK. On 17 January 1986 they applied for its merger with their two properties as required in their acquisition permit (see paragraph 23 above) and on 11 April 1986 the merger was accepted by the local property formation agency (fastighetsbildningsmyndigheten)."}

referred to the Court by a Swiss national, Mr Hans W. Kopp (\u201cthe applicant\u201d) on 20 January 1997, by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) on 22 January 1997 and by the Government of the Swiss Confederation (\u201cthe Government\u201d) on 27 February 1997, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 23224/94) against Switzerland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by Mr Kopp on 15 December 1993. The applicant\u2019s application bringing the case before the Court referred to Article 48 of the Convention, as amended by Protocol No. 9, which Switzerland has ratified; the Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby Switzerland recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46); the Government\u2019s application referred to Articles 45, 47 and 48. The object of the request and of the applications was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention.\n\nOn 20 January 1997 the applicant had designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 31 of Rules of Court B), who was given leave by the President to use the German language in both the written and the oral proceedings (Rule 28 \u00a7 3). The applicant was initially designated by the letters H.W.K., but subsequently agreed to the disclosure of his identity.\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr L. Wildhaber, the elected judge of Swiss nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 4 (b)). On 21 February 1997, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mrs E. Palm, Mr A.B. Baka and Mr M. Voicu (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 5). Subsequently Mr J.M. Morenilla, substitute judge, replaced Mrs Palm, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 \u00a7 1 and 24 \u00a7 1).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant\u2019s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 \u00a7 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the memorials of the Government and the applicant on 19 and 27 September 1997 respectively. On 7 October 1997 the Commission produced the documents on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President\u2019s instructions.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 November 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr P. Boillat, Deputy Director, Head of the International Affairs Division, Federal Office of Justice, Agent, Mr F. B\u00e4nziger, Deputy Federal Public Prosecutor, Mr F. Sch\u00fcrmann, Head of the Human Rights and Council of Europe Section, Federal Office of Justice, Advisers; (b) for the Commission Mr B. Marxer, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr T. Poledna, of the Z\u00fcrich Bar, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr Marxer, Mr Poledna and Mr Boillat.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. the CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nMr Hans W. Kopp, a Swiss national born in 1931, was formerly a lawyer and lives in Z\u00fcrich (Switzerland).\n\nA. Background to the case\n\nThe applicant\u2019s wife, Mrs Elisabeth Kopp, was a member of the Federal Council and head of the Federal Department of Justice and Police from 1984 until her resignation in January 1989.\n\n1. The letter of request\n\nOn 28 February 1988 a Mr Hauser, a member of the law firm Kopp and Partners, was asked by a client to verify the legality of a request for judicial assistance sent to Switzerland by the United States authorities concerning a tax matter. After studying the file, Mr Hauser declined to accept the work, referring to a standing instruction to members of the applicant\u2019s firm to refuse all cases concerning the Federal Department of Justice and Police, for which his wife was at that time responsible. The file was accordingly transferred to the law firm Niederer, Kraft and Frey in Z\u00fcrich.\n\nOn 10 June 1988 Niederer, Kraft and Frey asked the Federal Office of Police if they could inspect the letter of request. On 23 August 1988 the Federal Office sent the firm an abridged (gestrippte) version of the document, withholding a confidential section which concerned organised crime.\n\n2. Mrs Kopp\u2019s resignation\n\nIn November 1988, in a separate development, the media reported allegations that a company, Shakarchi Trading AG, and Mr Kopp, who was at the relevant time the vice-chairman of its board of directors, were implicated in money laundering. At the end of 1988 Mr Kopp lodged a complaint against a newspaper.\n\nAt his wife\u2019s request, the applicant had resigned as vice-chairman of the board in October 1988. His wife then came under suspicion of disclosing confidential information obtained in an official capacity. As her husband was also suspected of other offences, she was obliged to resign.\n\n3. The establishment of a parliamentary commission of inquiry\n\nOn 31 January 1989 the Swiss parliament set up a parliamentary commission of inquiry to look into the way Mrs Kopp had performed her duties, and the circumstances of her resignation.\n\nIn February 1989 the chairman of the parliamentary commission of inquiry, Mr Leuenberger, was informed that a Mr X, an American citizen, had obtained from the applicant a document which the Federal Office of Police and the Federal Court had refused to communicate to him, in exchange for a payment of 250,000 Swiss francs. Mr Leuenberger was given this information by a Mr Y, who had himself obtained it from the initial informant, a Mr Z.\n\nIt subsequently transpired that Mr X was named in the American letter of request, which contained confidential information about his role in organised crime. Suspicion therefore arose that a member of the Federal Department of Justice and Police might have passed on confidential documents relating to the request, thus breaching the duty not to disclose official secrets.\n\nB. The course of the inquiry and monitoring of the applicant\u2019s telephone lines\n\nOn 21 November 1989 the Federal Public Prosecutor opened an investigation against a person or persons unknown in order to question the informant Y and to identify the person working at the Federal Department of Justice and Police who might have disclosed official secrets.\n\nHe also ordered monitoring of the telephone lines of the informants Y and X, and of those of Mr Kopp and his wife. The applicant was monitored as a \u201cthird party\u201d, not as a suspect.\n\nThe monitoring began on 21 November 1989 and ended on 11 December 1989.\n\nOn 23 November 1989 the President of the Indictment Division of the Federal Court allowed an application by the Federal Public Prosecutor for monitoring of thirteen telephone lines in total, including the applicant\u2019s private and professional lines and those of his wife, and in particular a secret line allocated to her as a former member of the Federal Council. The order expressly mentioned that \u201cthe lawyers\u2019 conversations [were] not to be taken into account\u201d.\n\nOn 24 November 1989 the parliamentary commission of inquiry published its report. It concluded that Mrs Kopp had performed her duties with competence, diligence and circumspection, and that the rumours to the effect that she had allowed external influences to affect the way she performed her duties were unfounded. In February 1990 the Federal Court acquitted Mrs Kopp of disclosing official secrets.\n\nOn 1 December 1989 the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office interviewed the informant Y, in the presence of the chairman of the parliamentary commission, Mr Leuenberger.\n\nOn 4 December 1989 Mr Leuenberger contacted the informant Z, who was interviewed by the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office on 8 December.\n\nOn 12 December 1989, having concluded that the suspicions regarding the disclosure of official secrets were unfounded, the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued monitoring of all Mr and Mrs Kopp\u2019s telephone lines.\n\nOn 14 December 1989 the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office submitted its final report on the investigation, which stated that in 1988 Mr Hauser had passed on to the firm of Niederer, Kraft and Frey a file relating to the letter of request (see paragraph 8 above) and that there was no evidence that the applicant and his wife had been directly involved in that case.\n\nOn 6 March 1990 the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office decided to close the investigation, on the ground that there was no evidence to corroborate the suspicions that the applicant\u2019s wife or a member of the Federal Department of Justice and Police had disclosed official secrets, namely certain passages of the letter of request which had been classified as confidential.\n\nIn a letter of 9 March 1990 the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed Mr Kopp that a judicial investigation had been opened, pursuant to Articles 320 and 340 \u00a7 1 (7) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 34 below), in connection with the suspected disclosure of official secrets, and that his private and professional telephone lines had been tapped, in accordance with sections 66 et seq. of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act (see paragraphs 35\u201338 below). The letter stated that the monitoring had lasted from 21 November to 11 December 1989 and that \u201cconversations connected with his professional activities as a lawyer [had not been] monitored\u201d. It also stated that, pursuant to section 66(1 ter) of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act, all the recordings had been destroyed.\n\nOn 12 March 1990 the parliamentary commission of inquiry issued a communiqu\u00e9 concerning the monitoring of Mr Kopp\u2019s telephone lines in connection with the judicial investigation concerning him. It stated in particular: \u201cIn the course of its inquiries, in connection with which it obtained authorisation to intercept telephone communications, the [Federal] Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office discovered that the American citizen\u2019s Swiss representatives had tried to obtain the confidential document in the file by applying to [the applicant]. They were hoping for privileged access to the Federal Department of Justice and Police on account of the fact that he was the husband of the Federal Councillor then responsible for that Department. For a fee, a lawyer from [the applicant]\u2019s law firm studied the file in order to decide whether to take on the case, but turned it down. An attempt was then made to obtain the confidential part of the file through another lawyer. The American letter of request was in the end disclosed, but only after the confidential passages had been blotted out. On the basis of these findings, the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the investigation\u2026 The suspicion that there had been a disclosure of official secrets thus proved to be unfounded. The police investigation did, however, reveal how the rumour that led to the information and the suspicion arose.\u201d\n\nOn 13 March 1990 a number of Swiss newspapers commented on the above communiqu\u00e9. They mentioned the applicant among the persons implicated and mentioned that telephones had been tapped.\n\nC. The proceedings brought by the applicant\n\n1. The complaint to the Federal Department of Justice and Police\n\nOn 10 April, 3 September and 10 October 1990 Mr Kopp lodged complaints with the Federal Department of Justice and Police about breaches of the legislation on telephone tapping and of Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 2 November 1992 the Federal Department dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints. Considering that they were to be classified as complaints to a higher authority, it refused him unrestricted access to his file.\n\n2. The administrative appeal to the Federal Council\n\nOn 2 December 1992 Mr Kopp lodged an administrative appeal with the Federal Council against the decision taken on 2 November 1992 by the Federal Department of Justice and Police. He complained, among other matters, of unlawful telephone tapping and of the refusal to give him free access to the file. Under the heading \u201cViolation of Article 8 of the Convention\u201d, he made the following submission in particular: \u201cIn that context, it should also be noted that the telephone lines of [the applicant]\u2019s law firm, which included a number of partners, were tapped. Section 66(1 bis) of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act expressly prohibits the interception of such telephone conversations. Interception of telephone conversations with [the applicant]\u2019s law firm was therefore likewise illegal under the above-mentioned provision of Swiss law.\u201d\n\nOn 30 June 1993 the Federal Council dismissed the administrative appeal. It observed that, where telephone tapping was concerned, a complaint to a higher authority, even one which had no basis in law, was to be treated as a normal administrative appeal. It held that it had jurisdiction to determine whether monitoring of the applicant\u2019s telephone lines had been unlawful, whether that measure had been in breach of the Convention and whether the applicant\u2019s right to inspect his file had been infringed. If his personal rights had been infringed, the applicant could claim damages. He could also rely on the Federal Council\u2019s decision in order to seek redress (Genugtuung) from the Federal Court. (a) The right to inspect the file The Federal Council considered that the applicant should have access only to those documents in the file which were directly relevant to the fact that he had had his telephone tapped as a \u201cthird party\u201d. It noted that he had had restricted access to the documents, some of which had been censored, particularly as regards the informants\u2019 names. Others, which concerned, for instance, the telephone tapping, had not been made available to him, but he had been orally informed of their existence and content. Several documents concerning third parties had not been handed over to him because their interests prevailed over his. (b) The lawfulness of the telephone tapping According to the Federal Council, section 66 of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act authorised monitoring the telephones of third parties, such as the applicant, if there was evidence giving rise to a presumption that they were receiving information from an offender or imparting information to him. It considered that in the period of general uncertainty due to rumours of subversion which had then obtained (eine durch Unterwanderungsger\u00fcchte verunsicherte Zeit) there had been specific evidence pointing to a disclosure of official secrets by someone within the Federal Department of Justice and Police. The document in question contained confidential information about which guarantees had been given to the United States. The credibility of Switzerland had therefore been at stake. An apparent risk had been identified when the name of the applicant, who was the husband of the former head of the Department of Justice and Police, was mentioned. According to the Federal Council, it had been necessary to tap the telephone lines at the beginning of the investigation, before contacts were established with Mr Y and Mr Z. The civil servants concerned had therefore not immediately looked into the informants\u2019 credibility, considering that any further contact would have compromised the investigation. The Federal Council observed that the applicant had had his telephone tapped not as a suspect but as a \u201cthird party\u201d within the meaning of section 66(1 bis) of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act. The conversations he had had in the capacity of lawyer had been expressly excluded. As he was not a civil servant, he could not have been guilty of the offence concerned. His wife had been one of the theoretically possible suspects, but there was no real evidence implicating her or anyone else. The fact that the applicant\u2019s telephone lines had been monitored did not mean, therefore, that he had been under suspicion in the criminal sense. Moreover, the fact that the police investigation had been initiated in respect of \u201ca person or persons unknown\u201d was not simply a ploy to preserve appearances. Lastly, the investigation had not been ordered for political reasons and the chairman of the parliamentary commission had not been in a position to influence it. In conclusion, the Federal Council observed that the conversations recorded had been of no interest to the investigators and no report on them had been made. Be that as it may, even if such a report had been sent to the parliamentary commission, it could not have been used improperly because its members were bound by the duty not to disclose official secrets.\n\n3. The administrative-law appeal to the Federal Court\n\nThe applicant also lodged with the Federal Court an administrative-law appeal against the decision taken on 2 November 1992 by the Federal Department of Justice and Police (see paragraph 29 above). He asked the Federal Court to rule that the telephone tapping had been unlawful and accordingly to order the institution of criminal proceedings against those responsible.\n\nOn 8 March 1994 the Federal Court gave judgment against the applicant. It first considered whether he should have been permitted to inspect the whole of the file when the case had been brought before the Federal Department of Justice and Police. It noted that he had been able to inspect those passages in the document which had determined the decision (entscheidungswesentlich) and that the decision not to disclose the informants\u2019 names had been justified. It held that the above conclusion was also consistent with the parliamentary commission of inquiry\u2019s decision to guarantee the informants\u2019 anonymity. Moreover, on the basis of even a partial inspection of the file (gest\u00fctzt auf die ihm zugestellten \u201cgestrippten\u201d Akten), the applicant had been able to lodge appeals. The Federal Court then considered whether criminal proceedings should be brought in connection with the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s telephone lines. It held that it was not required to provide a conclusive (abschliessend) answer to the question whether the telephone tapping constituted a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, having regard in particular to the fact that the applicant had already appealed to the Federal Council. It noted that criminal proceedings had been instituted for a presumed disclosure of official secrets on the basis of information passed on by the chairman of the parliamentary commission of inquiry. The applicant\u2019s firm was involved inasmuch as one of his partners had looked into the case in order to decide whether he should take it on. The presumption by the Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office that the first informant or the disloyal civil servant would contact the applicant did not seem to have been wholly unjustified."}

for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Necdet Bertan (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 15 January 2008. The applicant was represented by Mr A.F. Demirkan, a lawyer practising in Bursa.\n\nOn 12 June 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Bursa.\n\nIn 2004 the General Directorate of Highways seized a plot of land belonging to the applicant without any formal expropriation, for the construction of a highway. The applicant brought an action before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain compensation for the de facto expropriation of his property. He requested 5,500 Turkish liras (TRY) as compensation from the court and reserved his right to increase this claim in due course.\n\nOn 15 June 2006 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicant TRY 5,500 as compensation for the de facto expropriation of his land, as requested, plus interest. The applicant initiated execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain that amount (file no. 2009/2806).\n\nOn 13 March 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nThe applicant subsequently brought an additional action (\u201cek dava\u201d) before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain further compensation for his land in the light of the expert report obtained during the previous proceedings, which had valued the land at a rate higher than that initially requested by him.\n\nOn 24 May 2007 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicant TRY 59,568.50, plus interest. The applicant initiated another set of execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain the amount awarded (file no. 2007/6188).\n\nOn 23 October 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Karacabey Civil Court.\n\nOn 24 March and 13 November 2009 the administration paid TRY 8,923 and 92,113 respectively in respect of the debt arising from the actions before the Bursa Execution Office.\n\nAccording to the information provided by the applicant, there has been no outstanding debt in the execution files."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 19180/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by six Turkish nationals, Mrs Nafiye \u00c7etin, Mr Necat \u00c7etin, Mr Nezir \u00c7etin, Mr Adnan \u00c7etin, Mrs Nuriye Kaym\u0131\u015f and Leman Ekingen (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 30 April 2003.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr S. Korkmaz, Mr A. S\u00fcer and Ms I. Midyat, lawyers practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 5 November 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1929, 1972, 1956, 1966, 1963 and 1953 respectively, and live in Mersin except for the third and the fourth applicants who reside in Diyarbak\u0131r and \u015eanl\u0131urfa respectively.\n\nThe first applicant\u2019s son and the other applicants\u2019 brother, Harun \u00c7etin, was a student at the Istanbul University at the time of the events.\n\nOn 15 March 1993 Harun \u00c7etin was arrested and taken into police custody, together with his friend Mr \u00d6.Y\u00fcce, at the Avc\u0131lar Campus of Istanbul University. They had Molotov cocktails in their possession.\n\nOn 16 March 1993, while in detention, Harun \u00c7etin\u2019s health deteriorated and he was admitted to \u015ei\u015fli Etfal Hospital. On the same day, he was transferred to Cerrahpa\u015fa hospital. On his arrival, Harun \u00c7etin was unconscious and had slight bruises and abrasions on various parts of his body. A brain scan revealed a subdural haematoma in the right fronto-temporo\u2011parietal region. He was immediately operated on and remained in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit until 9 June 1993, without, it appears, regaining consciousness. Harun \u00c7etin was later transferred, first to Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Reanimation Center and later to Taksim Hospital where he died on 5 September 1993. He was twenty years old.\n\nOn 8 September 1993, upon the request of the Beyo\u011flu public prosecutor, an autopsy was carried out on Harun \u00c7etin at the Cerrahpa\u015fa Medical Faculty. According to the autopsy report, drawn up on 22 December 1993, the cause of death was attributed to pneumonia related respiratory insufficiency which had developed as a result of his transition from active to passive, following the subdural brain haemorrhage suffered from a head trauma.\n\nIn the meantime, on 16 March 1993 Mr Y\u00fcce gave a statement to the police in which he claimed, inter alia, that he and Harun \u00c7etin had been beaten both by the police officers who had arrested them and by the police officers at the Avc\u0131lar police station where they were interrogated, and that Harun \u00c7etin\u2019s poor health might have resulted from these beatings.\n\nBetween 3 September 1993 and 4 October 1993, a prosecutor took the statements of eleven police officers who were working either at the Avc\u0131lar police station or the anti-terror branch of the Security Directorate.\n\nIn an indictment dated 31 December 1993, the public prosecutor at the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Assize Court accused Mr U.A., the police chief at the anti-terror branch of the Avc\u0131lar Security Directorate and Mr I.H., a police officer in the same department, of causing Harun \u00c7etin\u2019s death, unintentionally, as a result of ill\u2011treatment. They were also accused of ill-treating Mr Y\u00fcce. The charges were brought under Articles 452 \u00a7 1, 243 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 5 January 1994 the criminal proceedings against the accused police officers began before the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Assize Court. The first hearing was fixed for 8 April 1994.\n\nBetween 8 April 1994 and 24 February 2006 the court held thirty\u2011three hearings, during which it mainly took numerous procedural decisions in order to establish the whereabouts of Mr Y\u00fcce, without success.\n\nIn the hearing held on 8 April 1994 the applicants, except for Mrs Nuriye Kaym\u0131\u015f, joined the proceedings as civil parties (m\u00fcdahil).\n\nThe court heard the police officers, who denied the accusations against them at the hearing held on 1 July 1994.\n\nIn a petition dated 28 October 1994, the civil parties requested the court to conduct an additional investigation. In this connection, they asked the court to request the medical records of the deceased and to hear a number of witnesses, including the doctors who had treated Harun \u00c7etin and the police officers whose names featured in the official documents in respect of Harun \u00c7etin\u2019s arrest and detention.\n\nIn the hearing held on 16 May 1995, the court dismissed these requests as being irrelevant to the outcome of the case.\n\nOn 26 October 2001 the court decided not to hear Mr Y\u00fcce since he could not be found. However, at the next hearing on 31 May 2002, the prosecutor argued that, since no detailed statement had been obtained from Mr Y\u00fcce at the investigative stage, it was important for the court to hear him. In this connection, the prosecutor noted that Mr Y\u00fcce had claimed to have been beaten on arrest and at the police station, and that the Avc\u0131lar central police station and the anti-terror branch were in the same building. The court agreed.\n\nOn 12 October 2005 the court, once again, decided not to hear Mr Y\u00fcce since he could not be found. On that date, the prosecutor submitted his observations on the merits.\n\nOn 24 February 2006 the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Assize Court held that the accused had ill-treated Harun \u00c7etin with a view to extracting a confession of guilt and had caused his death. The police officers were sentenced to six years and six months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to Articles 452 \u00a7 1 and 59 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. The court decided to discontinue the proceedings regarding the ill-treatment of Mr Y\u00fcce as that prosecution had become time-barred (zamana\u015f\u0131m\u0131).\n\nThe police officers appealed.\n\nThe applicants submitted that, since they feared that a further prolongation in the case would result in its dismissal for being time-barred, they did not appeal against this decision.\n\nOn 26 February 2007 the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion, mentioning the approaching time-bar.\n\nOn 9 May 2007 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on account of an insufficient investigation into the events in question. In this connection, it considered that the first-instance court should have heard Mr Y\u00fcce and the witnesses mentioned in the applicants\u2019 petition of 28 October 1994.\n\nThe case was remitted to the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Assize Court on 20 June 2007. In the hearing held on 21 November 2007, the court decided to obtain the medical records of the deceased and to hear two persons cited by the applicants in their petition of 28 October 1994.\n\nThe proceedings are still pending."}

Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Ms Maria Polkowska (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 14 April 2008.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Jakub Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 18 December 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nThe Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike the application out of its list of cases, in accordance with Article 37 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Otwock.\n\nA. Civil proceedings for division of matrimonial property\n\nOn an unspecified date in January 1987 the applicant's former husband instituted civil proceedings for division of matrimonial property.\n\nDuring the proceedings the Otwock District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) decided on several occasions, of its own motion, to stay the proceedings due to the fact that the plaintiff had not paid the relevant costs arising in the course of the proceedings.\n\nOn numerous occasions the applicant requested the court to resume the proceedings and to proceed speedily with the claim.\n\nOn 5 March 1998 the applicant complained to the President of the Warsaw Regional Court (Prezes S\u0105du Wojew\u00f3dzkiego) about the delay in the proceedings.\n\nOn 8 April 2004 the proceedings were resumed.\n\nOn 20 October 2006 the Otwock District Court gave a decision ordering the plaintiff to pay a certain amount to the applicant. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 29 October 2007 the Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) partly amended the first-instance decision and dismissed the remainder of the appeal.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 15 February 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d).\n\nThe applicant sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Otwock District Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN).\n\nOn 6 May 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicant's complaint. It limited its examination of the length\u2011of\u2011proceedings issue to the period after the entry into force of the 2004 Act and stressed that the Act could not be applied to the protracted length of court proceedings occurring before that date. Having analysed the conduct of the District Court during the period after the entry into force of the 2004 Act (that is after 17 September 2004), the Regional Court found that there were no delays for which the District Court could be held responsible. It held that the proceedings had been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time."}

Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Senanik \u00d6ner and Mr Ferhan T\u00fcrk (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 27 June 2012.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr E. Talay, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicants alleged that there had been an interference with their right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nOn 29 May 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, Senanik \u00d6ner and Ferhan T\u00fcrk, were born in 1952 and 1951 respectively and live in Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nOn 21 March 2007 the applicants attended the Newroz celebrations in K\u0131z\u0131ltepe, a district of Mardin, and made certain speeches concerning the problems of Kurdish people. The relevant extracts from the applicants\u2019 statements can be summarised as follows: \u201cFor the attention of the press and public: I celebrate your day of Newroz. I commemorate the civilians who were killed by the members of security forces in Cizre, Nusaybin and \u015e\u0131rnak. The PKK declared a ceasefire to stop the bloodshed and to contribute to the peace establishment process. Subsequently, the PKK also withdrew its armed forces out of the borders of Turkey to maintain peace. We expect affirmative steps from the state. (...) The Kurdish leader, \u201cSay\u0131n0\u201d Abdullah \u00d6calan has been poisoned and this is a very serious problem. Turkey should order an investigation into the \u00d6calan \u2018poisoning\u2019. (...) The state did not take any steps for democratisation or to solve the Kurdish problem. We believe in peace and the state should take appropriate steps for solving the Kurdish problem.\u2019\u2019\n\nSubsequently, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicants by the K\u0131z\u0131ltepe Public Prosecutor, charging them with disseminating terrorist propaganda on behalf of an illegal organisation, the PKK (Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party, an illegal organisation), under Section 7 \u00a7 2 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).\n\nOn 15 April 2008 the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court found the applicants guilty as charged and sentenced them to one year and eight months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nOn 28 December 2011 the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court\u2019s judgment.\n\nThe applicants learned of this decision on 6 March 2012.\n\nOn 12 October 2012, following an amendment to the law, the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court revised its judgment pursuant to Provisional Article 1 \u00a7 1 of the Law no. 6352 and suspended the execution of the applicants\u2019 sentences."}

Kingdom and D.S. v. the United Kingdom) on 12 April 1995 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) and on 3 May 1995 by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\u201cthe Government\u201c), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). The case of Stubbings and Others originated in an application (no. 22083/93) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 14 May 1993, by three British nationals, Ms Leslie Stubbings, Ms J.L. and Ms J.P. and the case of D.S. originated in an application (no. 22095/93) against the United Kingdom lodged on 14 June 1993 by Ms D.S., also a British national. The Commission\u2019s request and the application of the Government referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the cases disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6, 8 and 14 of the Convention (art. 6, art. 8, art. 14).\n\nIn response to the enquiries made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30).\n\nThe President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, decided that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the two cases should be heard by the same Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 9 May 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, Mr Ryssdal drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr N. Valticos, Mr I. Foighel, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr J.M. Morenilla and Mr J. Makarczyk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicants\u2019 lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government\u2019s memorial on 3 January 1996 (a single memorial dealing with both cases: Rule 37 para. 3 in fine) and the applicants\u2019 memorials on 4 January 1996.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision (Rules 37 para. 3 in fine and 39), a joint hearing of both cases took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 April 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr I. Christie, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr D. Anderson, Counsel, Mr M. Collon, Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department, Adviser; (b) for the Commission Mr N. Bratza, Delegate; (c) for the applicants Ms Stubbings, J.L. and J.P. Mr K. Boyle, Counsel, Mr T. Fisher, Solicitor; (d) for the applicant D.S. Mr M. Wynne-Jones, Counsel, Mr P. Sykes, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza, Mr Boyle, Mr Fisher, Mr Wynne-Jones and Mr Anderson.\n\nOn 23 April 1996 the Chamber ordered the joinder of the two cases (Rule 37 para. 3 in fine).\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. The circumstances of the case\n\n(1) Ms Stubbings 8. Ms Leslie Stubbings was born on 29 January 1957. She was placed by a local authority in the care of Mr and Mrs Webb when she was nearly two years old and adopted by them when she was three. The Webbs had two children, of whom the elder, Stephen, was born on 21 July 1952. 9. Ms Stubbings alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Mr Webb and committed acts of indecency at his instigation on a number of occasions between December 1959 (before her adoption) and December 1971 (when she was fourteen years old). These were of a serious nature, although they did not involve full sexual intercourse. In addition, she alleges that Stephen Webb forced her to have sexual intercourse with him on two occasions in 1969 when she was twelve and he was seventeen. 10. Since 1976 Ms Stubbings has experienced severe psychological problems, which have led to her admission to hospital on three occasions. She has been variously diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, emotional instability, paranoia, depression and agoraphobia, and she has once attempted suicide. 11. In September 1984, following treatment by a consultant child and family psychiatrist, she allegedly realised for the first time that there might be a connection between the childhood abuse and her mental health problems. 12. On 18 August 1987 she commenced proceedings against her adoptive parents and brother, seeking damages for the alleged assaults. The defendants applied to have the claim dismissed as time-barred under the Limitation Act 1980 (\u201cthe 1980 Act\u201c: see paragraph 35 below). 13. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal which considered the case were bound by earlier authority (Letang v. Cooper: see paragraph 32 below) to hold that Ms Stubbings\u2019 claim was based on a \u201cbreach of duty\u201c within the meaning of section 11 of the 1980 Act (see paragraph 35 below). The limitation period for such actions was three years, either from the date on which the cause accrued or from the date on which the plaintiff first knew the injury in question was both significant and attributable to the defendants. Section 33 of the 1980 Act provided that the court could allow such an action to proceed even if commenced after the expiry of the three\u2011year period where it would be equitable to do so (see paragraph 35 below). 14. The High Court found in favour of the defendants, ruling that Ms Stubbings\u2019 \u201cdate of knowledge\u201c was more than three years before the commencement of proceedings. The Court of Appeal, however, accepted Ms Stubbings\u2019 argument that although she had always remembered that she had been abused by Mr Webb and Stephen, she did not realise that she had suffered sufficiently serious injury as to justify bringing a claim until September 1984, when she came to understand the causal link between the assaults and her mental health problems. 15. The defendants appealed to the House of Lords (Stubbings v. Webb [1993] Appeal Cases, p. 498). Lord Griffiths, with whom the other four law lords agreed, doubted that the \u201cdate of knowledge\u201c was as late as September 1984, since \u201cI have the greatest difficulty in accepting that a woman who has been raped does not know that she has suffered a significant injury\u201c. Furthermore, after considering the report of the Tucker Committee (see paragraph 31 below), he held that the words \u201cbreach of duty\u201c in section 11 (1) of the 1980 Act did not embrace actions based on intentionally inflicted injuries, such as rape and indecent assault. Instead, these types of claim were subject to the six-year limitation period provided for in section 2 of the 1980 Act. This limit, which could not be disapplied by the court, started to run from the plaintiff\u2019s eighteenth birthday (section 28: see paragraph 35 below). The claim was therefore out of time. (2) Ms J.L. 16. Ms J.L. was born in 1962. She alleges that between 1968 and September 1979 she was frequently abused by her father, who took pornographic photographs of her and subjected her to serious assaults of a sexual nature. 17. Between 1981 and 1991, she suffered from bouts of depression and found it difficult to form relationships. In 1990 she began to have nightmares about her childhood abuse. Finally, in October 1990, she asked her doctor for help and he referred her to a psychologist. At this time, she allegedly gained insight into the connection between the abuse and her mental health problems for the first time. Initially this worsened her condition, causing her to attempt suicide in December 1990. 18. In January 1991 she consulted solicitors with a view to commencing proceedings for damages against her father. Legal aid was granted and a writ was issued on 26 March 1991. A medical report prepared in May 1991 for the purposes of the litigation described her as suffering from severe psychological damage, which manifested itself in an inability to trust others, constant mood swings, insomnia and anxiety. According to the report, she was likely to remain damaged for the rest of her life and would have an increased risk of developing a mental illness. 19. Ms J.L. also reported the alleged abuse to the police. They interviewed her and her father, but in September 1991 decided not to bring charges. When she was informed of this decision she made another attempt at suicide. 20. Following the decision of the House of Lords in Stubbings v. Webb (see paragraph 15 above), her civil claim against her father was discontinued on the advice of counsel that it had become time-barred in 1986, six years after her eighteenth birthday. (3) Ms J.P. 21. Ms J.P. was born in 1958. Between the ages of five and seven she attended a state primary school in Highgate, London, but her parents withdrew her in 1966 because she had become depressed and withdrawn and was suffering from nightmares. It appeared that the Deputy Headmaster, a Mr P., had been removing her from lessons, purportedly to look after his two-year-old daughter. 22. From that time onwards, Ms J.P. had difficulty in sustaining relationships and felt \u201cdifferent\u201c and lonely. Following her father\u2019s death in 1985 she suffered extreme feelings of bereavement, which eventually drove her to seek psychiatric help. She underwent a course of therapy which, in February 1989, prompted her to experience a violent recall of being subjected to sexual abuse by Mr P. She subsequently recovered memories of other assaults by him, including incidents of rape. 23. In October 1991 she instructed solicitors to commence proceedings for damages against Mr P. and a writ was issued on 10 February 1992. However, legal aid was withdrawn and the action was discontinued following the decision of the House of Lords in Stubbings v. Webb (see paragraph 15 above), because her claim had become time-barred in January 1982. (4) Ms D.S. 24. Ms D.S. was born in 1962. Between 1968 and 1977 she was allegedly subjected to repeated sexual assaults by her father, including acts of rape. She asserted that, as a result of the abuse, she suffered from feelings of despair, depression, fear and guilt and found it difficult to sustain relationships. 25. On 15 March 1991 D.S.\u2019s father pleaded guilty to a charge of indecent assault based on his abuse of her. He was sentenced to one year\u2019s probation. 26. The applicant considered that this was insufficient punishment and she therefore instituted civil proceedings against her father on 14 August 1992. A report from a psychologist stated that it would have been impossible for her to have taken this step earlier, because she had largely blocked out memories of the abuse as a means of survival. 27. Her action was discontinued on 24 May 1993 following the House of Lords\u2019 judgment in Stubbings v. Webb (see paragraph 15 above), since her claim had been brought outside the six-year time-limit held in that case to apply."}

the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 11 July 1985, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 9248/81) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission on 2 November 1980 under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish citizen, Mr. Torsten Leander.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision from the Court as to whether the facts of the case disclosed violations by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 8, 10 and 13 (art. 8, art. 10, art. 13) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. G. Lagergren, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 3 (b)). On 2 October 1985, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. J. Cremona, Mr. G. Wiarda, Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Sir Vincent Evans and Mr. R. Bernhardt (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 4) (art. 43). Mr. J. Gersing, substitute judge, subsequently replaced Mr. Wiarda, whose term of office as judge had expired before the hearing, and at a later stage Mr. F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc and Mr. C. Russo, substitute judges, replaced Mr. Gersing and Mr. Cremona, who were prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case (Rules 2 \u00a7 3, 22 \u00a7 1 and 24 \u00a7 1).\n\nMr. Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 5). He ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201c), the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant regarding the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 \u00a7 1). On 12 December 1985, he directed that the lawyer and, should he so decide, the Agent should each have until 4 February 1986 to file a memorial and that the Delegate should be entitled to reply in writing within two months from the date of the transmission to him by the Registrar of whichever of the aforesaid documents should last be filed. The applicant\u2019s memorial was received at the registry on 3 February. By letter the same day, the Agent of the Government stated that the Government did not intend to file any memorial. On 21 March, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would present his observations at the hearing.\n\nOn 3 April 1986, after consulting, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant, the President directed that the oral proceedings should open on 26 May 1986 (Rule 38). On 28 April, the Commission communicated to the Registrar a number of documents whose production he had requested on the instructions of the President. On 12 May, certain additional documents furnished by the applicant were received at the registry.\n\nThe hearing was held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before it opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr. H. Corell, Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. K. Bergenstrand, Assistant Under-Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Mr. S. H\u00f6glund, Head of Division, National Police Board, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr. H. Schermers, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr. D. T\u00f6llborg, Counsel, Mr. J. Laestadius, Adviser.\n\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr. Corell for the Government, by Mr. Schermers for the Commission and by Mr. T\u00f6llborg for the applicant, as well as their replies to questions put by the Court and several judges.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Mr. Torsten Leander, is a Swedish citizen born in 1951 and a carpenter by profession.\n\nOn 20 August 1979, he started to work as a temporary replacement in a post of museum technician (vikarierande museitekniker) at the Naval Museum at Karlskrona in the south of Sweden. The museum is adjacent to the Karlskrona Naval Base which is a restricted military security zone. The applicant maintained before the Court that the intention was that he should work for ten months in this post, while its ordinary holder was on leave. He alleged that on 3 September he was told to leave his work pending the outcome of a personnel control which had to be carried out on him in accordance with the Personnel Control Ordinance 1969 (personal-kontrollkung\u00f6relsen 1969:446 - see paragraphs 18-34 below). According to the applicant, this control had been requested on 9 August 1979. The Government submitted that the applicant was employed only from 20 August to 31 August 1979, as evidenced by a notice to this effect, issued on 27 August 1979 by the Director of the Museum. They further contended that in employing Mr. Leander the Director had committed two mistakes. Firstly, it was not in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Ordinance and the relevant regulations issued thereunder to employ a person before a personnel control had been undertaken and, secondly, the post had not been properly declared vacant.\n\nThe necessary steps were taken on 30 August 1979. The post was opened for application until 28 September 1979. Mr. Leander did not apply.\n\nIt appears that on 25 September the Director informed him that the outcome of the personnel control had been unfavourable and that he could therefore not be employed at the Museum.\n\nFollowing the advice of the Security Chief of the Naval Base, the applicant wrote to the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (chefen f\u00f6r marinen) requesting to be informed of the reasons why he could not be employed at the Naval Museum. In his reply of 3 October 1979, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy stated, inter alia: \u201cThe Museum possesses several storage rooms and historical objects within the area for the security of which the Chief of the Naval Base (\u00f6rlogsbaschefen) is responsible. According to the information received by the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, the person holding the post in question must have freedom to circulate within areas subject to special restrictions regarding access. The rules on access to these areas must therefore also be applied to the personnel employed at the Museum. It is for these reasons that the Chief of the Naval Base requested a personnel control. The control carried out has provided such grounds for the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s assessment of you from a security point of view that the decision has been taken not to accept you. However, if your duties at the Naval Museum will not necessitate that you have access to the naval installations at the Naval Base, the Commander-in-Chief sees no reason to oppose your employment. The decision whether or not to employ you is taken in a procedure distinct from the present one.\u201c\n\nOn 22 October 1979, the applicant complained to the Government and requested that the assessment of the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy be cancelled and that he be declared acceptable for the temporary employment at the Naval Museum, irrespective of the possibility of being reinstated in that employment. He pointed out in particular that he had left a permanent position in Dalarna, in the North of Sweden, on being told that he was accepted for employment at the Naval Museum and that a negative outcome of the personnel control could mean social misery, especially considering that he had a wife and child to support. In his original complaint, and also in a letter of 4 December 1979, Mr. Leander further requested that he be given information about the reasons for his not being accepted at the Naval Museum. The Government requested the opinion of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces (\u00f6verbef\u00e4lhavaren), who in turn consulted the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy explained in a letter of 7 November 1979 that he had received the result of the personnel control from the Supreme Commander on 17 September 1979 together with the following proposal: \u201cAccepted in accordance with the assessment of the [Commander-in-Chief of the Navy], on condition that L. does not, through access to the Museum\u2019s premises or through his work, obtain insight into secret activities.\u201c The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy added that, according to his information, the Director of the Museum required the person employed in the post in question to have free access to, and freedom to circulate in, the Naval Base and that accordingly, on 21 September 1979, he had taken the decision not to accept the applicant. In his reply to the Government, the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces stated, inter alia: \u201cHowever, the employment of Mr. Leander during this time, 15 August - 1 September 1979, did not involve any access to the Naval Base. The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy has said that he does not oppose such employment. The Director of the Naval Museum has, however, affirmed the requirement that Mr. Leander should have access to the Naval Base. In view of the above and the fact that, if Mr. Leander was given access to the Naval Base, he would have access to secret installations and information, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy decided not to accept the applicant. When dealing with the present case, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy has entirely followed existing regulations concerning the assessment of personal qualifications from a security point of view. ... Like the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces considers that Mr. Leander may properly be employed by the Naval Museum provided that the holder of the appointment does not require access to the Naval Base.\u201c The opinion of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces was accompanied by a secret annex, containing the information on Mr. Leander released by the National Police Board (rikspolisstyrelsen). This annex was never communicated to the applicant and has not been included in the material submitted to the Court.\n\nIn a letter of 5 February 1980, the applicant raised new grievances before the Government. These concerned the decision of the National Police Board not to exercise its powers under section 13 of the Personnel Control Ordinance to communicate to him the information released on him (see paragraph 31 below). The applicant requested that the Government should, before taking a decision on his request of 22 October 1979, give him the right to be apprised of and to comment upon the information thus released by the Board. On this matter, the Government sought the opinion of the Board. In its reply of 22 February 1980, the Board proposed that the applicant\u2019s complaints be dismissed. It added: \u201cThe entering of information in the register of the Board\u2019s Security Department is based mainly on a 1973 Royal Decree which is secret. Before information is entered, the question of registration is subject to assessment, at several levels, by civil servants under responsibility to verify compliance with the above-mentioned rules in relation to each item of information. In the event of doubt, the question of registration is decided upon by the Chief of the Security Department. Information from the register is handed out in accordance with section 9 of the Personnel Control Ordinance after decision by the National Police Board in plenary meeting. At least three of the six members of the Board who are appointed amongst parliamentarians should be present when decisions are taken in matters of personnel control. In the case of the applicant, all six members were present. ... Under section 13 of the Personnel Control Ordinance, the person whom the information concerns ought to be given the opportunity to submit observations on the matter if special reasons give cause for this. However, the National Police Board did not see any cause to apply this provision in the case of the applicant as no special reasons were found, and also as the registering had been effected in accordance with the secret Royal Decree and disclosure of the information would have revealed part of the contents of that Decree.\u201c Mr. Leander replied to this opinion in a letter of 11 March 1980 to the Government, in which he argued, inter alia, that the Board should have communicated to him, at least orally and subject to a duty of confidentiality, the information kept on him.\n\nBy decision of 14 May 1980, the Government rejected the whole of the applicant\u2019s complaint. In its operative parts, the decision read: \u201cThe question whether or not a person is suitable for certain employment can only be examined by the Government in the context of a complaint about the appointment to a post. Leander has lodged no appeal with the Government in respect of appointment. His request that the Government should declare him acceptable for the provisional employment concerned cannot therefore be examined. In the present case, there are no such special circumstances as are mentioned in section 13 of the Personnel Control Ordinance which would give Leander the right to be acquainted with the information about him released by the National Police Board to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The remainder of Leander\u2019s petition is a request to be given an extract from, or information about the contents of, a police register. The Government reject [this] request ... The Government do not examine Leander\u2019s request for a revised assessment of his person and take no measure in regard to any other part of his petition.\u201c\n\nThe applicant maintained before the Court that he still did not know the content of the secret information recorded on him. Regarding his personal background, he furnished the following details to the Commission and the Court. At the relevant time, he had not belonged to any political party since 1976. Earlier he had been a member of the Swedish Communist Party. He had also been a member of an association publishing a radical review - Fib/Kulturfront. During his military service, in 1971-72, he had been active in the soldiers\u2019 union and a representative at the soldiers\u2019 union conference in 1972 which, according to him, had been infiltrated by the security police. His only criminal conviction stems from his time in military service and consisted of a fine of 10 Swedish Crowns for having been late for a military parade. He had also been active in the Swedish Building Workers\u2019 Association and he had travelled a couple of times in Eastern Europe. The applicant asserted however that, according to unanimous statements by responsible officials, none of the above-mentioned circumstances should have been the cause for the unfavourable outcome of the personnel control."}

European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) and on 15 May 1995 by the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (\u201cthe Government\u201c), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c). It originated in an application (no. 15573/89) against Sweden lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish national, Mr Torgny Gustafsson, on 1 July 1989. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request and of the Government\u2019s application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed breaches by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6, 11 and 13 of the Convention (art. 6, art. 11, art. 13) and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 31).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 5 May 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Matscher, Mr B. Walsh, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr F. Bigi and Mr P. Jambrek (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant\u2019s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 para. 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government\u2019s memorial on 12 September 1995 and the applicant\u2019s memorial on 13 September 1995. In a letter of 19 October 1995 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not wish to reply in writing.\n\nOn 28 September 1995 the Chamber, having regard to a request by the Government of 30 August, decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of a Grand Chamber (Rule 53). The President and the Vice-President, Mr R. Bernhardt, as well as the other members of the Chamber being ex officio members of the Grand Chamber, the names of the other nine judges were drawn by lot by the President in the presence of the Registrar on 28 September 1995 (Rule 53 para. 2 (a) and (b)), namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr B. Repik and Mr E. Levits.\n\nOn 24 October 1995 the Grand Chamber dismissed a request to hear witnesses which the Registrar had received from the Government on 17 October (Rule 43 para. 1, taken together with Rule 53 para. 6). On various dates between 19 and 25 October, the Registrar received letters from the applicant providing comments on the above request.\n\nOn 27 September, 24 October 1995 and 10 January 1996 the applicant submitted further particulars on his Article 50 (art. 50) claims. On 10 November 1995 the Commission produced a number of documents from the file in the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President\u2019s instructions.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 22 November 1995. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr C.H. Ehrenkrona, Assistant Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr D. Ekman, Permanent Under-Secretary,Ministry of Labour, Mr P. Virdesten, Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ministry of Labour, Mrs I. \u00c5kerlund, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Labour, Mrs H. J\u00e4derblom, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Justice, Advisers; (b) for the Commission Mrs G.H. Thune, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr G. Ravnsborg, Lecturer in Law at the University of Lund, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mrs Thune, Mr Ravnsborg and Mr Ehrenkrona, and also replies to questions put by the Court and by the President.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE THE CASE\n\nFrom the summer of 1987 until the end of the summer of 1990 the applicant owned the summer restaurant Ihrebaden at Ihreviken, Tingst\u00e4de, on the island of Gotland. The applicant further owned - and continues to own - the youth hostel Lummelunda at Nyhamn, Visby, also on Gotland. The restaurant\u2019s employees numbered less than ten. They were engaged on a seasonal basis, but had the option of being re-employed the following year. The applicant\u2019s ownership of the restaurant and youth hostel was direct and entailed his personal financial liability (enskild firma).\n\nAs the applicant was not a member of either of the two associations of restaurant employers, namely the Swedish Hotel and Restaurant Entrepreneurs\u2019 Union (Hotell- och Restaurangar - betsgivaref\u00f6reningen - \u201cHRAF\u201c, which is affiliated to the Swedish Employers\u2019 Confederation (Svenska Arbetsgivaref\u00f6reningen - \u201cSAF\u201c)) and the Employers\u2019 Association of the Swedish Union of Restaurant Owners (Svenska Restaurat\u00f6rsf\u00f6rbundets Arbetsgivaref\u00f6rening - \u201cSRA\u201c), he was not bound by any collective labour agreement (kollektivavtal) between the two associations and the Hotel and Restaurant Workers\u2019 Union (Hotell- och Restauranganst\u00e4lldas F\u00f6rbund - \u201cHRF\u201c). Nor was he obliged to subscribe to the various labour-market insurance schemes (Arbetsmarknadsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring) developed through agreements between SAF and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (Landsorganisationen). It was, however, open to the applicant to accede to a collective agreement by accepting a substitute agreement (h\u00e4ngavtal). He could also subscribe to insurance schemes with Labour-Market Insurances or any of the other ten or so insurance companies in the field.\n\nIn late June or early July 1987 he refused to sign a separate substitute agreement with HRF. He referred to his objections of principle regarding the system of collective bargaining. He also emphasised that his employees were paid more than they would have been under a collective agreement and that they themselves objected to his signing a substitute agreement on their behalf. The substitute agreement proposed to the applicant included these terms: \u201cParties: [The applicant] and [HRF] Term of validity: From 1 July 1987 up to and including31 December 1988, thereafter for one year at a time, unlessnotice is given two months prior to the expiry of the[agreement] ... As from the [above] date, the most recent agreement between[the employers\u2019 association] and [HRF] shall be applied between[the applicant and HRF]. Should [the employers\u2019 association]and [HRF] subsequently reach a new agreement or agree to amendor supplement the [present] agreement, [the new agreement,amendments or supplements] shall automatically apply as fromthe day on which [it or they] [has or have] been [agreed upon]. ...\n\n[The employer shall] [on his employees\u2019 behalf] subscribeto and maintain [five different] insurance-policy schemes withLabour-Market Insurances, ... as well as other possibleinsurance-policy schemes which [the employers\u2019 association andHRF] might later agree upon.\n\n[The employer shall] issue employment certificates on aspecial form ... A copy shall be sent to [HRF].\n\n[The employer shall] only employ [workers who are members]of or [have] requested membership of [HRF]. In the event ofre-employment the provisions of section 25 of the EmploymentProtection Act (lag (1982:80) om anst\u00e4llnings-skydd) shallapply.\n\n[The employer shall] deduct on a monthly basis a part ofthe salary of employed members of [HRF] corresponding to theirmembership fees, and pay [the deducted part] to [HRF]. ...\u201c\n\nOn 16 July 1987, during further negotiations with the applicant, HRF proposed another substitute agreement, which he also rejected: \u201cSubject: The signing of a collective agreement regarding [therestaurant] Ihrebaden ... and the Lummelunda youth hostel.\n\nHaving regard to the forthcoming end of the [season of1987] the parties agree on the following procedure replacing the signing of a collective agreement. The enterprise agrees to comply, during this season ..., with the collective labour agreement (`the green nationalagreement\u2019) between [HRAF] and [HRF], this including the obligation to subscribe to [certain] insurance schemes(avtalsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringar) with Labour-Market Insurances.\n\nThe enterprise also agrees to [comply with] [the]collective labour agreement ... during the next season ...,either by way of membership of the employers\u2019 union or bysigning a ... substitute agreement ...\u201c\n\nHad the applicant accepted a substitute agreement, it would have applied not only to those of his employees who were unionised but also to those who were not. In the summer of 1986, one member of HRF was employed by the applicant. In 1987 he employed another member of that union and also two persons who were respectively members of the Commercial Employees\u2019 Union (Handelsanst\u00e4lldas F\u00f6rbund) and the Union of Municipal Workers (Kommunalarbetaref\u00f6rbundet). In 1989, one member of the latter union was employed by the applicant.\n\nFollowing the applicant\u2019s refusal to sign a substitute agreement, HRF, in July 1987, placed his restaurant under a \u201cblockade\u201c and declared a boycott against it. Sympathy industrial action was taken the same month by the Commercial Employees\u2019 Union and the Swedish Food Workers\u2019 Union (Svenska Livsmedelsarbetaref\u00f6rbundet). In the summer of 1988 sympathy action was also taken by the Swedish Transport Workers\u2019 Union (Svenska transportarbetaref\u00f6rbundet) and the Union of Municipal Employees (Kommunaltjenestemannaf\u00f6rbundet). As a result deliveries to the restaurant were stopped.\n\nOne of the persons employed by the applicant at Ihre baden who was member of HRF had publicly expressed the opinion that the industrial action was unnecessary, as the salary and working conditions in the restaurant were not open to criticism. According to the Government, the union action had its background in a request for assistance in 1986 by an HRF member employed by the applicant. In the view of the union, the applicant paid his employees approximately 900 Swedish kronor (SEK) a month less than what they would have received under a collective agreement. He did not pay his staff holiday compensation as provided for in the 1977 Annual Leave Act (semesterlagen 1977:480), nor salary during lay-offs due to poor weather conditions as required by the 1982 Employment Protection Act and he did not sign a labour-market insurance until 1988.\n\nIn August 1988 the applicant, invoking the Convention, requested the Government to prohibit HRF from continuing the blockade and the other trade unions from continuing their sympathy action and to order the unions to pay compensation for damages. In the alternative, he requested that compensation be paid by the State.\n\nBy a decision of 12 January 1989 the Government (Ministry of Justice) dismissed the applicant\u2019s request. The Government stated: \u201cThe requests for a prohibition of the blockade and thesympathy action as well as compensation for damage from thetrade unions concern a legal dispute between private subjects.According to Chapter 11, Article 3, of the Instrument of Government [Regeringsformen which forms part of theConstitution], such disputes may not be determined by anypublic authority other than a court of law, except by virtueof law. There is no provision in the law which authorises theGovernment to examine such disputes. The Government will not,therefore, examine these requests on the merits. The claim for damages is dismissed.\u201c\n\nThe applicant applied to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten) for review under the 1988 Act on Judicial Review of Certain Administrative Decisions (lag (1988:205) om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut - \u201cthe 1988 Act\u201c). On 29 June 1989 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the application on the ground that the Government\u2019s decision did not concern an administrative matter involving the exercise of public power, which was a condition for review under section 1 of the Act.\n\nOn 15 September 1989 the Swedish Touring Club (Svenska turistf\u00f6reningen - \u201cSTF\u201c), a non-profit-making association promoting tourism in Sweden, terminated the membership of the applicant\u2019s youth hostel, referring to a lack of cooperation and the applicant\u2019s negative attitude towards STF. As a result, the hostel was no longer mentioned in STF\u2019s catalogue of youth hostels in Sweden. In 1989 about half of the youth hostels in Sweden were enrolled in STF.\n\nThe applicant brought proceedings in the District Court (tingsr\u00e4tten) of Stockholm. He contested what he considered to be his personal exclusion from STF, alleging that it had been caused by HRF threats that it would take industrial action against other youth hostels enrolled in STF if his hostel was not excluded. He also challenged STF\u2019s termination of the membership of his youth hostel. STF accepted, inter alia, that although the termination of the membership contract concerning the applicant\u2019s youth hostel had not been prompted by the conflict between the applicant and the trade unions, this conflict might have affected the timing of the decision. STF also referred to an opinion of the Competition Ombudsman (ombudsmannen f\u00f6r n\u00e4ringsfrihet) of 14 November 1989 to the effect that the termination of the contract in question would have only a very limited impact on his business.\n\nBy a judgment of 8 May 1991 the District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s action on both points. It found, inter alia, that the applicant had not shown that he had been personally excluded from STF by virtue of the termination of STF\u2019s contract concerning his youth hostel. It also found that he had not shown that the contract had been financially significant to his business. Reference was made to the Competition Ombudsman\u2019s finding.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovr\u00e4tt) which, on 6 March 1992, upheld the District Court\u2019s judgment. The Court of Appeal found, inter alia, that STF\u2019s termination of the contract concerning the youth hostel had entailed the expiry of the applicant\u2019s personal membership of STF. This, however, had not been tantamount to his exclusion, given that he could have continued or renewed his membership. Moreover, although the contract had been of appreciable significance to the applicant\u2019s business, STF\u2019s termination of the contract could not be considered unreasonable.\n\nAt the beginning of 1991 the applicant sold his restaurant due to his difficulties in running his business which had allegedly been caused by the industrial action. The restaurant was bought by a person who signed a collective agreement with HRF. He continued, together with his family, to run the youth hostel in Lummelunda. Following the above, the union action was terminated.\n\nOn 9 November 1991 the applicant requested the Government to support his application to the Commission. On 12 December 1991 the Government decided not to take any action in respect of the request."}

the Swiss Confederation (\u201cthe Government\u201c). The case originated in an application (no. 8737/79) against that State lodged with the Commission on 30 August 1979 under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention by two Swiss nationals, Mr. Werner Zimmermann and Mr. Johann Steiner.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s request and the Government\u2019s application were lodged with the registry of the Court within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 \u00a7 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) - the former on 17 May and the latter on 8 July 1982. The request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the Swiss Confederation recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46), and the application to Articles 45, 47 and 48 (art. 45, art. 47, art. 48). The object of the request and the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the length of the proceedings relative to the hearing of the applicants\u2019 appeal to the Swiss Federal Court had exceeded the reasonable time stipulated by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n\nThe Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, the elected judge of Swiss nationality (Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention), and Mr. G. Wiarda, the President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Rules of Court). On 28 May 1982, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. F. Matscher, Mr. J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Mr. R. Macdonald and Mr. R. Bernhardt (Article 43 (art. 43) in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 4). Subsequently, Mr. Bernhardt was exempted by the President from sitting and was replaced by Mr. D. Evrigenis (Rule 24 \u00a7 4). Mr. Wiarda, who had assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 5), ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission regarding the procedure to be followed. On 12 October 1982, he decided, having particular regard to their concurring statements, that it was not necessary for memorials to be filed and that the oral proceedings should open on 24 January 1983. By Order of 22 December 1982, the President requested the Government and the Commission to supply certain documents; these were received at the registry on various dates.\n\nThe hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 24 January 1983. Immediately before they opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting; it had authorised the person assisting the Delegate of the Commission to use the German language (Rule 27 \u00a7 3). There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr. J. VOYAME, Director of the Federal Office of Justice, Agent, Mr. P. M\u00dcLLER, Director of the registry of the Swiss Federal Court, Mr. O. JACOT-GUILLARMOD, Federal Office of Justice, Mr. B. M\u00dcNGER, Federal Office of Justice, Counsel;\n\nfor the Commission Mr. J. SAMPAIO, Delegate, Mr. L. MINELLI, the applicants\u2019 representative before the Commission, assisting the Delegate (Rule 29 \u00a7 1, second sentence, of the Rules of Court). The Court heard addresses by Mr. Voyame for the Government and by Mr. Sampaio and Mr. Minelli for the Commission, as well as their replies to its questions.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nMr. Werner Zimmermann and Mr. Johann Steiner were born in 1937 and 1904 respectively. Mr. Zimmermann is a fitter and resides at Uster (Z\u00fcrich); Mr. Steiner is retired and resides at Bargen (Berne). Until 30 September 1976, each of the applicants was the tenant of a flat, Mr. Zimmermann in Kloten and Mr. Steiner in R\u00fcmlang; these localities are close to Z\u00fcrich-Kloten airport, which is in the territory of, and operated by, the Canton of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nA. Proceedings before the Federal Assessment Commission\n\nIn 1974, the applicants sought compensation from the Canton of Z\u00fcrich for the damage caused by the noise and air pollution resulting from the operation of the airport; Mr. Zimmermann claimed a lump sum of 28,242 SF and Mr. Steiner a lump sum of 54,199 SF. Having been unable to arrive at a settlement with them, the Canton applied on 17 June 1974 for assessment proceedings to be opened under section 57 of the Federal Expropriation Act of 20 June 1930. The case was referred to the Federal Assessment Commission having jurisdiction in the matter, namely the Commission for the Tenth District; on this occasion it was presided over by a judge of the St. Gallen Higher Court and also comprised an architect, an engineer and the registrar of that court (sections 59 et seq. of the above-mentioned Act, Order of 24 April 1972 on the Federal Assessment Commissions and Order of 17 May 1972 on the Federal Assessment Districts).\n\nThe Assessment Commission rejected the applicants\u2019 claims by a decision of 6 October 1976, which was served on them on 7 March 1977. It recognised that under Swiss case-law and legal theory tenants could in principle rely on the law of nuisance (voisinage) set out in the Civil Code (Articles 679 and 684); however, it considered that the applicants were alleging non-pecuniary damage and not damage to property, whereas only the latter fell to be taken into account under the Federal Expropriation Act.\n\nB. Proceedings before the Federal Court\n\nOn 18 April 1977, Mr. Zimmermann and Mr. Steiner lodged with the Federal Court an administrative-law appeal against the Federal Assessment Commission\u2019s decision (section 77 \u00a7 1 of the Federal Expropriation Act). The Federal Court sought the views of the Assessment Commission on 27 April. The latter filed its observations on 18 May 1977 and the administrative authorities of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich filed theirs on 24 May 1977. This concluded the pleadings (proc\u00e9dure contradictoire).\n\nThe applicants\u2019 lawyer wrote to the Federal Court on 8 September 1978 to enquire about the state of the proceedings. It replied, on 21 September, that it had not yet been able to deal with the case because of its excessive workload, but hoped to be able to give a decision during the coming months. The Federal Court enclosed with its letter a copy of the observations filed by the Canton of Z\u00fcrich. The applicants reverted to the matter on 15 March 1979. In a letter of 23 March, the judge acting as rapporteur of the First Public-Law Chamber of the Federal Court informed them that, save for unforeseen circumstances, a decision would be given before the court vacation. On 29 June 1980, the applicants\u2019 lawyer again asked the Federal Court for information about the state of the proceedings. On 11 July, the judge acting as rapporteur, whilst expressing his regrets about the delay in examining the case, replied that judgment would be delivered after the court vacation.\n\nThe First Public-Law Chamber of the Federal Court dismissed the appeal on 15 October 1980. Its judgment, which was fifteen pages in length, began by analysing the situation of residential and agricultural tenants in the event of expropriation. It went on to observe that when - in 1967 and 1958 respectively - the applicants signed their leases, which were renewable every three months, they were aware of the nuisance to which they would be subjected; they had not established that it had grown noticeably worse in the meantime (section 41 of the Expropriation Act).\n\nC. The Federal Court\u2019s excessive workload and the measures taken to deal with it\n\nAccording to the statistics supplied by the Government, from 1969 to 1979 the total number of appeals rose from 1,629 to 3,037, that is an increase of 86%. The rate of growth was 107% for public-law appeals (1,336 against 634) and as much as 318% for administrative-law appeals (590 against 141). As early as 1970, the Federal Assembly decided to increase the number of members of the Federal Court from 26 to 28 and the number of substitute judges from 12 to 15; thereafter the Public-Law and Administrative-Law Chamber had 11 members instead of 9. In its report for 1971, published on 1 February 1972, the Federal Court drew attention to a build-up in the volume of litigation; it stated that \u201cdespite the increase, in 1970, in the number of judges\u201c, it would \u201calready have to consider at an early date the measures to be taken to deal with the growth in the quantity of cases\u201c. In November 1973, the Federal Court submitted to the Federal Government a number of urgent proposals designed to reduce this excessive workload; at the same time it suggested that a thorough review be undertaken of the whole organisation of the Federal courts, especially in public- and administrative-law matters, as regards its objectives and its relationship with the administration of the Cantonal courts. In its message of 22 May 1974 to the Federal Assembly, the Federal Government put forward draft texts designed, on the one hand, to modify the Federal Constitution of the Courts Act as regards the Public-Law and Administrative-Law Chamber of the Federal Court and, on the other hand, to amend the Federal Decree fixing the number of registrars and secretaries; it proposed that the number of judges be increased from 28 to 30 and the number of registrars and secretaries from 24 to 28. In its preliminary observations, the Federal Government stated: \u201cThe cases coming before the Public-Law and Administrative-Law Chamber of the Federal Court constitute a task which, for a long time now, has been growing continuously and threatening to become an excessive workload of a permanent nature; in the long term and having regard to the Court\u2019s present organisation, it will not be possible to keep abreast of this task without there being detrimental effects on the quality of the handling of cases and, at the end of the day, on protection under the law.\u201c However, the Federal Court itself requested that these reforms be deferred, pending a full-scale revision of the Federal Constitution of the Courts Act; this revision has not yet been effected (see paragraph 16 below).\n\nIn its report for 1977, dated 14 February 1978, the Federal Court recorded that there had been no diminution in the growth of its caseload, above all in the area of public and administrative law. It attributed this not only to the extension of the Confederation\u2019s powers in administrative matters but also to the fact that citizens were having increased resort to the guarantees which the law afforded to them vis-\u00e0-vis the public authorities. On 14 December 1977, the Federal Court had recommended to the Federal Government urgent measures similar to those it had sought in 1973. As a result, in 1978 the Federal Assembly took a first series of decisions. It increased the number of Federal judges from 28 to 30 and, with effect from 1 February 1979, the number of registrars and secretaries from 24 to 28. It also decided to split the Public-Law and Administrative-Law Chamber into two Public-Law Chambers. The Federal Court, for its part, adopted on 14 December 1978 revised Rules of Procedure which also came into force on 1 February 1979. Public-law and administrative-law cases are now distributed, according to their subject-matter, amongst the different Divisions of the Federal Court.\n\nThese reforms were to prove insufficient. In its management report for 1979, dated 12 February 1980, the Federal Court recorded that 3,037 cases had been brought and 2,786 disposed of during the year; however, it had been necessary to carry over to 1980 the examination of some 1,565 cases that is more than half of those registered in 1979. The Federal Court observed that the vast majority (84%) of the cases remaining on its list concerned public and administrative law and stated: \u201cIn these areas, if no immediate solution is found, a litigant will in future have to wait for years before the Court rules on his case. In a State governed by the rule of law, such a situation is incompatible with the role that should be played by the Supreme Court.\u201c The Federal Government therefore proposed in their message of 17 September 1980 to the Federal Assembly that the number of registrars and secretaries be increased from 28 to 60. It should be noted that these are not junior administrative staff but highly-qualified lawyers who play an essential role in the functioning of the Federal Court (Rule 10 of the Federal Court\u2019s Rules of Procedure, dated 14 December 1978); indeed they act in a consultative capacity during deliberations (Rule 12, second paragraph).\n\nIn its management report for 1980, dated 6 February 1981, the Federal Court pointed out that the situation was still serious. It regretted that the two legislative Chambers had not yet been able to adopt the Government\u2019s proposals and added: \u201cOwing to its overwhelming workload, the Court is now no longer able, in certain areas, to fulfil its role as guardian of the law, even though for its part it is doing everything possible, as regards internal organisation, to keep abreast of its obligations.\u201c On 20 March 1981, the Federal Assembly adopted a Decree raising from 28 to 40 the posts for registrars and secretaries of the Federal Court and also increasing its administrative staff. These measures led to some improvement: in its report for 1981, dated 12 February 1982, the Federal Court noted that for the first time since 1975 it had succeeded in disposing of almost as many cases (3,164) as had been registered (3,187); however, it had been obliged to adjourn 1,787. It concluded from this that \u201cfor some years more it will remain burdened by an excessive workload and will therefore not be able to decide cases within a time which would, having regard to their nature, appear reasonable in terms of the Constitution and the Convention\u201c.\n\nQuite apart from these decisions intended to cater for the immediate problem, the Federal committee of experts preparing a full-scale revision of the Federal Constitution of the Courts Act of 16 December 1943, designed to reduce the Federal Court\u2019s workload and accelerate its proceedings, completed its work at the end of 1981. Recently, the Federal Office of Justice and Police submitted a preliminary draft text to the Government, with a view to setting in motion a consultation procedure which should be terminated in 1983.\n\nThe Federal Court has itself taken practical steps aimed at coping with its backlog of pending business. Believing that to process cases in chronological order would give rise to serious injustices, it has, in particular, utilised a system, known as \u201csorting\u201c, based on the degree of urgency and the human implications of each case. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nIn their application of 30 August 1979 to the Commission (no. 8737/79), Mr. Zimmermann and Mr. Steiner alleged that the length of the proceedings relative to the hearing of their administrative-law appeal to the Federal Court (18 April 1977 - 15 October 1980) had exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201c stipulated by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n\nThe Commission declared the application admissible on 18 March 1981. In its report of 9 March 1982 (Article 31 (art. 31) of the Convention), the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1). FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nAt the hearings of 24 January 1983, the Government requested the Court \u201cto hold that in the present case Switzerland has not violated Article 6 \u00a7 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention\u201c."}

against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a German national of Turkish origin, Mr Asim Sahin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 June 1993.\n\nThe German Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agents, Mrs H. Voelskow-Thies, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice, at the initial stage of the proceedings, and subsequently by Mr K. Stoltenberg, Ministerialdirigent, also of the Federal Ministry of Justice. The applicant was, exceptionally, granted leave to represent himself (Rule 36 of the Rules of Court).\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the German court decisions dismissing his request for a right of access to his child, born out of wedlock, amounted to a breach of his right to respect for his family life and that he was a victim of discriminatory treatment in this respect. He relied on Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1, and composed of Mr A. Pastor Ridruejo, President, Mr G. Ress, Mr L. Caflisch, Mr I. Cabral Barreto, Mr V. Butkevych, Mrs N. Vaji\u0107, Mr M. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4, judges, and Mr V. Berger, Section Registrar. On 12 December 2000 the application was declared admissible as regards the applicant's complaints that the German court decisions dismissing his request for a right of access to his daughter, born out of wedlock, amounted to a breach of his right to respect for his family life and that he was a victim of discriminatory treatment in this respect.\n\nOn 11 October 2001 the Chamber delivered its judgment in which it held, by five votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. It also held, by five votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 and that the respondent State was to pay the applicant (i) DEM 50,000 (fifty thousand German marks) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and (ii) DEM 8,000 (eight thousand German marks) in respect of costs and expenses. The separate opinion of Mr Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4 joined by Mrs Vaji\u0107 was annexed to the judgment.\n\nOn 9 January 2002 the Government requested, in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 73, that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber, contending that the Chamber should not have found violations of Article 8 and 14 of the Convention. They maintained that the Chamber had erred in its approach to the margin of appreciation left to the national courts. Referring to Elsholz v. Germany ([GC], no. 25735/94, ECHR 2000-VIII), they further considered that, in the present case, the application of the former German legislation, namely Article 1711 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, had not led to discrimination between fathers of children born out of wedlock and divorced fathers.\n\nOn 27 March 2002 a panel of the Grand Chamber decided to refer the case to the Grand Chamber.\n\nThe composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. Mr J.-P. Costa, who was unable to take part in the final deliberations, was replaced by Mr P. K\u016bris (Rule 24 \u00a7 3).\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed a memorial.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, born in 1950, was a Turkish national at the time of the events complained of. He subsequently obtained German nationality.\n\nThe applicant is the father of G., born out of wedlock on 29 June 1988. In a document dated 15 June 1988, he acknowledged paternity of the unborn child, and in a further document, dated 15 August 1988, he acknowledged paternity and undertook to pay maintenance.\n\nThe applicant met the child's mother, Ms D., in 1985 and in December 1987 he moved into her flat, where they lived together until at least July 1989 or, as stated by the applicant, until February 1990. In any event, the applicant continued to visit the child and her mother until February 1990, and between the end of July and October 1990 he regularly fetched G. for visits. From November 1990 onwards, Ms D. prohibited any contact between the applicant and the child.\n\nOn 5 December 1990 the applicant applied to the Wiesbaden District Court for a decision granting him a right of access to his daughter on every Sunday from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. as well as on Boxing Day and Easter Monday.\n\nOn 5 September 1991 the District Court, having regard to the statements made by the parties and the Wiesbaden Youth Office and having considered evidence obtained from several witnesses, dismissed the applicant's request.\n\nThe court, referring to Article 1711 of the Civil Code, observed that the mother, as the person having custody, determined the father's right of access to the child and that the guardianship court could only grant the father a right of access if this was in the child's best interests. The court found as follows: \u201cThe Court is convinced that the petitioner's wish for [G.] to visit him is motivated by attachment to his child and genuine affection for her. It nonetheless takes the view that personal contact with her father is not in the child's best interests, since her mother dislikes her father so deeply and opposes all contact so fiercely that any visits ordered by the court would take place in a tense, emotionally charged atmosphere which would probably be extremely harmful to the child. The Court can discern no special circumstances which, given the strong differences between the parents, might make personal contact with her father appear beneficial for [G.] ... The relationship which developed between [G.] and her father in the period from her birth to her father's moving out \u2013 that is, approximately one year and nine months \u2013 is probably not of such fundamental importance that the risk of seriously upsetting the child by resuming contact opposed by her mother is worth taking. The staff who looked after [G.] at the day nursery, and who were questioned as witnesses, stated that she displayed no \u2013 or at least no serious and lasting \u2013 behavioural abnormalities when she was parted from her father and contact between them ceased, and that she is a balanced, cheerful and outgoing child. The evidence does not therefore confirm her father's claim that she missed him and frequently asked about him after their contact at the day nursery ceased. It has not therefore been shown that the conditions laid down in Article 1711 \u00a7 2 have been met, and the Court is accordingly obliged to dismiss the father's request.\u201d\n\nOn 12 March 1992 the applicant appealed to the Wiesbaden Regional Court.\n\nOn 12 May 1992 the Regional Court ordered a psychological expert opinion on the question whether contact with the applicant was in G.'s interests. On 8 July 1992, following a first conversation with the expert, the applicant challenged her for bias. He also requested that another expert be appointed on the ground that the scientific approach adopted did not reflect the latest state of research. On 9 September 1992 the Regional Court refused the applicant's request, finding that, taking into account the expert's explanations of 8 August 1992, there were no reasons to doubt her impartiality or her capabilities.\n\nOn 17 December 1992 the applicant requested the Regional Court to progress with the proceedings. He also applied for a provisional order granting him a right of access to G. during one afternoon every week and prohibiting her mother from obstructing such contact.\n\nOn 23 December 1992 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's request for a provisional order granting access. The Regional Court found that there was no urgency and that the applicant could be expected to await the outcome of the main proceedings. Furthermore, such an order would anticipate the possible terms of a final decision. Should a provisional order be issued and the request be eventually dismissed in the main proceedings, the disadvantages for the child would be more serious than those for the applicant in continuing with the prevailing situation.\n\nIn her opinion dated 25 February 1993, the expert noted that she had visited the applicant's family in June 1992 and again heard the applicant, the child's mother and the child on several occasions between November 1992 and February 1993. As regards her meetings with G., the expert explained that in the course of various games she had explored her feelings concerning persons and situations and concerning the applicant. They had also looked at a family photo album and G. had avoided looking at the more recent photographs. This reaction showed that G. had repressed the memories of her father. The expert reached the conclusion that a right of access without prior conversations to overcome the conflicts between the parents was not in the child's interests.\n\nBy a letter of 8 March 1993, the Regional Court, noting that the District Court had omitted to hear the child, enquired of the expert whether hearing the child in court on the issue of her relationship with her father would place a psychological strain on her.\n\nIn her reply of 13 March 1993, the expert indicated that she had not directly asked the child about her father. She had expected that G. would react spontaneously in the course of the meetings and express her feelings towards him. In the expert's view, the fact that G. had not mentioned her father was certainly relevant. The expert further referred to the last meeting, when they had glanced through a family photo album and she had asked G. about whether she still knew her father. On both occasions, she had appeared to repress her memories concerning him. The risk inherent in questioning her about whether she wished to see her father was that, in this conflict between the parents, the child might have the impression that her statements were decisive. Such a situation could provoke serious feelings of guilt.\n\nAt a court hearing on 30 April 1993, the applicant and the child's mother entered into an agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, the applicant declared that he would refrain from instituting any court proceedings, making any enquiries about the mother's personal circumstances and exercising his right of custody obtained under Turkish law on condition that they underwent parental therapy. The proceedings were suspended until the termination of this therapy.\n\nOn 1 June 1993 the applicant requested that the proceedings be resumed as the child's mother had not approved the two institutions for family therapy proposed by the applicant and had failed to react to his suggestion that she should make a proposal.\n\nOn 25 August 1993 the Wiesbaden Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal, finding as follows: \u201cPersonal contact with a child born out of wedlock is intended to allow a father to satisfy himself as to the child's welfare and development and preserve the natural ties existing between them. It is not therefore the purpose of granting access, but the legal conditions for doing so, which differ: while a parent who does not have custody of a child born in wedlock is entitled to access under Article 1634 [of the Civil Code], Article 1711 [of the Code] does not grant a right of access to the father of a child born out of wedlock. Rather, the law leaves it up to the person having custody, as a rule the mother, to determine whether, and to what extent, the father should be able to spend time with his child. However, the guardianship court may decide that the father is entitled to access if this is in the child's best interests. The main reason for the weaker legal position of the father of a child born out of wedlock is his different social position. After the Federal Constitutional Court's decisions of 1971 and 1981, the constitutionality of Article 1711 can no longer be seriously doubted. For considerations of legal policy, a reform of the law on children born out of wedlock is even more urgently necessary. In the meantime, the courts are bound by Article 1711. Under that provision, the guardianship court decides to grant a father access to a child born out of wedlock if this is beneficial for the child's welfare. It is not enough for such contact to be consistent with, or not contrary to, the child's interests, it must serve those interests and promote them. This interpretation justifies the assumption that fathers should generally be granted access to their children because this enables the latter to develop as normally as possible and helps them to form a clear image of themselves and their origin. It is in fact important for children not simply to have a fantasy picture of their fathers, but to be able to form a personal, realistic picture. Whether contact with the father is conducive to the child's well-being depends initially on the father's motives for seeking it. The Regional Court is convinced that the father in this case is motivated by attachment to [G.] and genuine affection for her. Even when a father acts from responsible motives, however, the court is not necessarily obliged to grant him access if there are serious tensions between the parents, these are communicated to the child, and there is reason to fear that every meeting with the father will interfere with the child's further undisturbed development in the residual family provided by the mother ... In view of the findings in the [psychological expert] report referred to above, it must be assumed that this would happen in the instant case. If the father were granted access to [G.] in present circumstances, she would have to shuttle between hostile camps, which should not be asked of her. If \u2013 as in this case \u2013 there is a danger that differences between parents may affect a child, then special circumstances are needed to justify the assumption that contact with the father will nevertheless have permanently beneficial effects on the child's development or well-being ... However, no such circumstances can be discerned here. It is true that, for the first two years of her life, [G.] grew up with both father and mother, but this period was not conflict-free. The disagreements and sometimes open aggression between her parents \u2013 in other words, the family violence she witnessed \u2013 have certainly left their mark on her, even if she can no longer recall them spontaneously. As the psychological report indicates, she has also repressed her old ties with her father \u2013 a fact reflected in the care she takes to avoid talking about him. In view of all this, the report finds that she does not suffer as a result of the present situation. The Court can rely fully on the report, which has no apparent defects and is not invalidated by the fact that the father sees the situation differently. In finding that therapy had not enabled the parents to put their former conflicts behind them, thus making it possible for [G.] to have access to both of them, the Court did not have to decide who was to blame for this ... The decisive factor is always the child's point of view. As already pointed out, however, the situation in this case is such that the parents must first initiate dialogue with each other.\u201d\n\nThe Regional Court finally considered that exceptionally it had not been required to hear the child, since questioning her about her relationship with her father would have placed a psychological strain on her. In this connection, the court referred to the expert's supplementary report of 13 March 1993 (see paragraph 23 above).\n\nOn 21 September 1993 the applicant filed a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court, complaining that the refusal of access to his daughter infringed his parental rights and amounted to discrimination, and alleging that the taking of expert evidence had been unfair. The Federal Constitutional Court acknowledged receipt on 29 September 1993. By a letter of 26 April 1994, the applicant asked the Constitutional Court about the state of the proceedings and urged a speedy decision. On 16 May 1994 the Constitutional Court informed him that in a similar case which had been registered at an earlier date a decision was envisaged for the first half of 1995. On 26 November 1995 the applicant sent a letter to the President of the Federal Constitutional Court complaining that the examination of his constitutional complaint had been postponed until the first half of 1996. In her reply of 15 February 1996 the judge dealing with the applicant's case informed him that, owing to the heavy workload of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1995, it had not been possible to take a decision. A decision was envisaged in 1996. Having regard to the importance of the subject matter, such a decision required careful preparation.\n\nOn 1 December 1998 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, refused to entertain the applicant's constitutional complaint."}

the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Swedish national, Ms Inga Allard (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 27 November 1996.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Lindquist, a lawyer practising in Tyres\u00f6. The Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Jagander, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the demolition of a house had violated her rights to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions and to respect for her home under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 8 of the Convention respectively.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 22 May 2001, the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other\u2019s observations.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was allocated to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Sp\u00e5nga.\n\nIn 1935 the applicant\u2019s mother and her four siblings jointly inherited two estates \u2013 Marum 1:6 and Marum 1:8 \u2013 from their father. The ownership of the estates, consisting of several islands in the archipelago of Stockholm, was over the years partly transferred to other members of the family. Disagreements arose between the family members. Some of them wished to divide the property (klyvning) and thus dissolve the joint ownership, but the applicant\u2019s mother opposed this idea.\n\nOn the land managed by the applicant\u2019s mother \u2013 which formed part of Marum 1:8 \u2013 the mother owned a number of houses. Two of the houses were used by the applicant\u2019s two sisters. A third house situated on the property was considered too small for the applicant\u2019s needs and it was therefore decided to enlarge it. The applicant applied for a building permit to the \u00d6ster\u00e5ker Building Committee (byggnadsn\u00e4mnden). On 9 September 1987, finding that the enlargement could not be approved as the house in question was situated too close to the shore, the committee nevertheless granted a permit for the building of a new house further away from the shore. The new house was built in 1988.\n\nOn 4 August 1989 the applicant\u2019s mother died, leaving four children, namely the applicant, her brother and her two sisters. However, no distribution of the mother\u2019s estate was made before 1991. By a partial division on 29 June 1991, the new house was transferred to the applicant.\n\nOn 21 December 1989 practically all the other joint owners of the two estates brought proceedings against the applicant in the District Court (tingsr\u00e4tten) of S\u00f6dra Roslag, requesting that she be ordered to remove the new house on Marum 1:8 as it had been built without their consent, contrary to the requirements of the Joint Ownership Act (Lagen om sam\u00e4gander\u00e4tt, 1904:48 \u2013 \u201cthe 1904 Act\u201d). The applicant disputed this and argued, inter alia, that it was her mother who had built the house and that accordingly it belonged to her mother\u2019s estate. Thus, she was not the proper defendant in the case.\n\nBy a judgment of 10 May 1990 (\u201cthe removal judgment\u201d) the District Court declared that the applicant was to remove the house, or risk having it demolished at her expense. The court stated, inter alia, that it was the applicant who owned the house and that she had built it without the necessary consent of all the other joint owners.\n\nIn 1991 one of the joint owners applied for the sale of Marum 1:6 and Marum 1:8 at a public auction. On 22 May 1992 the District Court decided to stay those proceedings.\n\nOn 22 February 1994 the District Court\u2019s removal judgment was upheld on appeal by the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovr\u00e4tt).\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen). She later requested, inter alia, that no further action be taken on the case pending the outcome of division proceedings which she had begun in October 1990. In these proceedings, the applicant claimed that the joint ownership of the two estates should be dissolved and individual plots be assigned to the family members. Following several decisions taken by the Real Estate Formation Authority (Fastighetsbildningsmyndigheten \u2013 \u201cthe REFA\u201d) and the courts, the case had to be referred back by the Court of Appeal to the REFA for re-examination as the latter had made procedural errors. Subsequently, by a decision of 1 December 1995, the REFA allowed the creation of four individual plots on Marum 1:8 but rejected the applicant\u2019s request for the creation of an individual plot around the new house on account of the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling that that house be removed. The applicant appealed against the REFA\u2019s decision to the Real Estate Court (fastighetsdomstolen) in Stockholm. As an alternative ground for staying the proceedings before the Supreme Court, the applicant pleaded that, in March 1995, she had requested that the District Court give a declaratory judgment on the question of ownership of the new house.\n\nBy a decision of 4 March 1996 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request to have the removal proceedings stayed and refused her leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, several family members requested that the Enforcement Office (kronofogdemyndigheten \u2013 \u201cthe Office\u201d) enforce the removal judgment. On 7 March 1996 the Office ordered the applicant to remove the house before 3 April 1996 or risk having it demolished by the Office at her own expense. By a later decision the time-limit was extended until 19 April 1996.\n\nOn 14 March 1996, at the Real Estate Court\u2019s request, the Central Office of the National Land Survey (Lantm\u00e4teriverket \u2013 \u201cthe Central Office\u201d) gave its opinion in the division proceedings. It considered that the removal judgment did not prevent the creation of an individual plot around the house in issue. On the contrary, this could preserve the house and reduce the risk of adverse consequences for the applicant. Thus, the Central Office recommended that the applicant be assigned an individual plot.\n\nHowever, on 3 April 1996 the Enforcement Office refused the applicant a further postponement of the enforcement of the removal judgment. On 15 May 1996 the District Court upheld the Enforcement Office\u2019s decisions and rejected the applicant\u2019s request for a stay of the enforcement. Subsequently, the Enforcement Office, on 20 May 1996, decided that the house was to be demolished by a construction firm on 3 June 1996.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, requesting an immediate stay of the demolition order. She submitted that enforcement of the removal judgment should be stayed until the division proceedings or, in the alternative, until the ownership proceedings had been concluded. She also claimed that she had not been given the opportunity to remove the house herself in accordance with the District Court\u2019s judgment of 10 May 1990. She stated that she had started to dismantle the house but was not able to complete the work before 3 June 1996. Furthermore, the applicant requested a three-week respite in order to substantiate her appeal.\n\nBy a decision of 31 May 1996 the Court of Appeal ordered the applicant to complete her appeal by 12 midnight on 5 June 1996. On the same day, that is on 31 May, the Court of Appeal received a letter from the applicant in which she requested an immediate stay of the demolition order. She submitted, inter alia, that enforcement of the removal judgment should be stayed until the division proceedings had been concluded or, in the alternative, until the Real Estate Court had decided the question. She also requested a three-week respite to substantiate her appeal.\n\nThe appellate court\u2019s order for the completion of the appeal \u2013 which was sent to the applicant\u2019s address at the time in Sp\u00e5nga \u2013 was allegedly not received by the applicant until the evening of 5 June, as she had been at the site of the house in issue. On the morning of 6 June she sent a fax to the appellate court, asking for a ten-day respite for the completion of her appeal.\n\nHowever, at a session held on 3 June 1996 the Court of Appeal had already examined the case and, by a decision delivered the following day, refused the applicant leave to appeal against the District Court\u2019s decision of 15 May 1996. Thus, no further stay of the enforcement proceedings was granted. It appears from the court files that the applicant called the Court of Appeal on 6 June and was told that the case had already been examined and that regard had been had to the contents of her letter of 31 May. On 5 July 1996 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal against the appellate court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe house in issue was therefore demolished by a construction firm. The applicant had claimed that her appeal against the District Court\u2019s decision of 15 May 1996 prevented the enforcement of the removal judgment. However, this claim was rejected by the Enforcement Office on 31 May 1996, referring to Chapter 3, section 21, of the Enforcement Code (Uts\u00f6kningsbalken). The demolition of the house began on 3 June 1996 and was concluded ten days later. On 25 June 1996 the Enforcement Office declared that the house had been demolished and that accordingly the removal judgment had been duly enforced. However, this decision was appealed against by the other joint owners on the ground that the building material had not been removed from the property. On 13 September 1996 the District Court, finding in favour of the appellants, quashed the Enforcement Office\u2019s decision that the enforcement had been finalised and referred the matter back to the Office. Leave to appeal against the District Court\u2019s decision was refused by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court on 30 September and 25 October 1996 respectively. On 27 September 1996 the Enforcement Office ordered the applicant to remove the building material from the property before 29 October 1996.\n\nOn 6 August 1996 the Enforcement Office ordered the applicant to pay the enforcement costs of 114,796 kronor. The applicant appealed and applied for legal aid in the matter. By a decision of 9 September 1996 the District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s application for legal aid on the ground that she did not have a legitimate interest in having the case heard as the enforcement had been concluded. The applicant\u2019s further appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 13 December 1996. On 28 April 1997 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.\n\nOn 22 November 1996 the Real Estate Court gave judgment in the division proceedings. It decided that Marum 1:8 should be divided into six individual plots and one common plot. The applicant was assigned a plot where the now demolished house had been situated. In this respect, the Real Estate Court thus agreed with the opinion given by the Central Office of the National Land Survey on 14 March 1996. The Real Estate Court\u2019s judgment was upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeal on 2 November 1998. On 14 April 2000 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.\n\nBy a judgment of 26 November 1996 the District Court decided another removal case which had been brought by the applicant and her sister in 1994. Apparently in response to the removal proceedings brought against the applicant, they had claimed that several other joint owners of Marum 1:6 and 1:8 should remove buildings they had erected on the estates. However, the District Court rejected the claims, finding that the buildings had been erected before 1991 \u2013 when the applicant and her sister, through the partial division of their mother\u2019s estate, had become joint owners of the two properties \u2013 and that the other joint owners at the time had expressly or impliedly consented to the various building projects. Furthermore, considering that the claimants did not have a legitimate interest in having their cases heard, the court also decided that further litigation in this respect should not be paid for through public legal aid. Thus, with effect from the date of the judgment, the legal aid previously awarded was withdrawn. The applicant and her sister appealed against the judgment, submitting, inter alia, that the District Court\u2019s decision on legal aid should be quashed. However, on 3 October 1997 the Court of Appeal upheld the legal-aid decision. On 16 January 1998 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal. Stating that they were unable to plead their case properly without legal aid, the applicant and her sister, by a letter to the Court of Appeal of 1 November 1999, withdrew most of their claims in the removal case.\n\nBy a declaratory judgment of 10 July 1997 in proceedings concerning the ownership of the house in issue, the District Court agreed with the applicant\u2019s argument, submitted to the court in March 1995, that the house had been erected on her mother\u2019s behalf and thus formed part of the latter\u2019s estate. Accordingly, at the time of the District Court\u2019s removal judgment of 10 May 1990, the house had not belonged to the applicant. Thus, in this respect, the court came to a different conclusion from the one reached in the removal judgment. Following an appeal, the declaratory judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 26 February 1998. No further appeal was lodged and the appellate court\u2019s judgment consequently acquired legal force.\n\nBy decisions of 4 February 1997 and 29 February 2000, the Building Committee granted the applicant building permits for the reconstruction of the demolished house and the construction of two smaller outbuildings."}

Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Cypriot national, Mr Yiannis Kyriakou (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 31 May 1991.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr E. Evripidou, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had deprived him of his home and properties.\n\nThe applicant died on 3 November 1994. No letters of administration having been granted for his estate, his lawful heirs are his wife, Mrs Andriana Yianni Kyriakou and his two sons, Andreas Ioannou and Kyriakos Ioannou. In September 1999 the applicant\u2019s heirs informed the Court that they wished to pursue the application on behalf of the deceased.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 8 June 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 \u00a7 1 (b)).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1908.\n\nThe applicant grew up in Trypimeni, a village in the District of Famagusta. He alleged that he was the owner of the following immovable properties in the village: (a) registration no. 5147, plot no. 20, sheet/plan 13/40, house with two rooms and one kitchen, one veranda, oven, trees and yard; the applicant alleged that two extra rooms and one kitchen had been added later; area of the plot of land: 530 sq. m; area of the house: 230 sq. m; (b) registration no. 2597, plot no. 442, sheet/plan 13/40, field with olive trees; area: 13,713 sq. m.\n\nIn support of his claim of ownership, the applicant submitted copies of the original title deeds. It appears from these documents that the applicant owned five twelfths of the property described above under paragraph 9 (a) and half of the property described above under paragraph 9 (b). However, in his observations of September 1999, the applicant\u2019s lawyer alleged that his client had had full ownership of the whole of the two plots. He submitted that from 1921 onwards only the applicant, his wife and his two children had been living in the house built on plot no. 20. This house had been the marital home from the time of his wedding and the applicant had had the absolute and unrestricted use and occupation of it. Moreover, from August 1928 the applicant had been cultivating and taking care of the whole of plot no. 442. He had been a farmer who earned his income from the production of the olive trees. In support of these statements, the applicant\u2019s lawyer produced a certificate issued by the Trypimeni village committee on 25 September 1999. The reason why the applicant had not been registered as the owner of the whole share of the two plots was that the applicant\u2019s mother, Mrs Maria Yianni, had been the owner of two twelfths of plot no. 20. She had given one twelfth of the plot to the applicant and one twelfth to his brother, Mr Elias Kyriakou, in the form of an unregistered gift. The applicant\u2019s brother had also been the owner of the remaining five twelfths of plot no. 20 and of the remaining half of plot no. 442. In 1956 Mr Elias Kyriakou, who had emigrated to Australia and had no intention of coming back to Cyprus, had given all his shares to the applicant. However, no official transfer of ownership had been entered in the land register. In support of his version of the facts, the applicant\u2019s lawyer produced an affidavit from the applicant\u2019s son, Mr Andreas Ioannou.\n\nIn July 1974, as the Turkish troops were advancing, the applicant and his family had to leave Famagusta and flee to the area still controlled by the Cypriot Government. The applicant had lived until his death in a small house located in a housing scheme for displaced persons.\n\nSince 1974 the applicant had been unable to return to his home and property in the northern part of Cyprus. He participated in various peaceful demonstrations and marches, but had been prevented from walking home by the Turkish troops. On 9 December 1990 the applicant took part once again in a car convoy organised by persons from three villages in Kyrenia and from Trypimeni wishing to return to their homes in the north peacefully. The participants in the convoy had informed the commander of the United Nations (UN) forces in Cyprus of their intention to return home. They drove to the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d checkpoint on the main road linking Nicosia and Famagusta. There they stopped and asked the UN officer on duty to be allowed to return to their homes, properties and villages. They requested him to transmit their demand to the Turkish military authorities. The UN officer announced to the applicant and the other participants in the convoy that the Turkish military authorities had refused their request to drive through the checkpoint and enter the northern part of Cyprus."}

with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a German national, Ms Gertraud Mitzinger (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 20 May 2010.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms C. Erk, a lawyer practising in Bayreuth. The German Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by one of their Agents, Ms K. Behr, of the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection.\n\nRelying on Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8, the applicant, who was born outside marriage, alleged that she had suffered discrimination on the grounds of her birth by the application of the relevant provisions of domestic inheritance law by the national courts.\n\nOn 26 May 2015 the complaint concerning alleged discrimination was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1940 in Troschenreuth, in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), and lives in Bayreuth.\n\nA. Background to the case\n\nThe applicant is the natural and only daughter of Mr A.W., who recognised paternity in 1951. She lived in the territory of the former GDR until 1984, while her father lived in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), having married. The father and the daughter corresponded regularly during that period. Between 1954 and 1959, the applicant also visited her father and his wife once a year. After the applicant obtained an exit permit in 1984 for herself, her husband and her younger daughter, she left the GDR and moved to Bavaria. Thereafter the applicant visited her father on a regular basis until 2007. He died on 4 January 2009.\n\nB. Proceedings in the domestic courts\n\nOn 14 January 2009 the applicant applied to the Memmingen District Court for the right to administer her father\u2019s estate, asserting the incapacity of her father\u2019s wife to protect the applicant\u2019s inheritance due to a grave illness, and notified the District Court of her inheritance claims. Furthermore, she asked to receive copies of all documents relating to the estate. She asserted that between 2002 and 2007 she had regularly visited her father at his retirement home and had talked to him on the telephone. Subsequently, her own health had prevented her from visiting. Telephone calls had been impossible because her father\u2019s health had meant he had no longer been able to use a telephone. The retirement home had been in possession of her address and telephone number, and had phoned her on several occasions.\n\nIn a decision of 28 January 2009 the Memmingen District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s application, as there were no indications that the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s wife could not protect the inheritance. In addition, being born before 1 July 1949 and thus not being a statutory heir, she had no right to receive copies of documents about the estate.\n\nOn 6 February 2009 the applicant appealed to the Memmingen Regional Court, arguing in particular that she needed the power to administer the estate because her father\u2019s wife suffered from dementia and that she was a statutory heir because she was her father\u2019s natural daughter.\n\nIn a decision of 23 February 2009 the Memmingen Regional Court upheld the District Court\u2019s decision refusing to give her the power to administer her father\u2019s estate, holding that the applicant was not a statutory heir and thus had no right to apply. The Regional Court referred to the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act of 19 August 1969 (see paragraph 15 below) and to a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of 8 December 1976, in which the provision had been found to be in conformity with the Basic Law (see paragraph 16 below).\n\nOn 8 March 2009 the applicant appealed to the Munich Court of Appeal, arguing that the application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act would discriminate against her and breach her inheritance rights and was therefore not in conformity with the Basic Law. The applicant pointed out that in her case there was no need to protect the legitimate expectations of the deceased or other heirs as she was her father\u2019s only daughter and her father had been separated from his wife for more than ten years when he had died. Furthermore, cultural and social changes within society had to be considered when interpreting the Basic Law.\n\nIn a decision of 14 May 2009 the Munich Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on the grounds that it was bound by the decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court in which the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act had been found to be in conformity with the Basic Law. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s view, the provision did not contravene the Basic Law, despite German reunification, as the Federal Constitutional Court had held in a decision of 20 November 2003 (file no. 1 BvR 2257/03).\n\nOn 17 July 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court, claiming discrimination as a result of the application of the aforementioned provision. According to her there were no apparent reasons why children born outside marriage should be treated differently from those born within marriage. That was particularly true in her case because she was her father\u2019s only child. The applicant argued that the Munich Court of Appeal, when considering an appeal, had to respect Article 6 \u00a7 5 of the Basic Law, which provided that children born outside marriage must be provided by legislation with the same opportunities for physical and mental development and for their position in society as those enjoyed by children born within marriage. That provision prohibited a generalised application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act.\n\nIn a decision of 8 December 2009 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the complaint, which it considered inadmissible for lack of sufficient substantiation (no. 1 BvR 2021/09). It observed, in particular, that the applicant had failed sufficiently to address the arguments of the Munich Court of Appeal\u2019s decision. As the applicant doubted the validity of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act, which had previously been declared valid by the Federal Constitutional Court, she had been obliged to give further reasons, which she had failed to do."}

Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Lech Majewski (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 18 June 1998.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent Mr. J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 24 August 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Szczecin, Poland.\n\nB. The first set of civil proceedings\n\n1. Facts before 1 May 1993\n\nOn 10 November 1990 the applicant lodged a civil action for compensation against the State Treasury - the Bia\u0142ystok Remand Centre with the Bia\u0142ystok District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy). He alleged that upon his arrival in the Bia\u0142ystok Remand Centre, on 14 December 1989, he had been beaten and insulted by the prison guards and had subsequently not received proper medical care. The applicant claimed that in consequence of the excessive use of force against him he had sustained a spinal injury and suffered permanent disability. At the first hearing held on 20 December 1990 the court appointed a lawyer under a legal aid scheme for the applicant and ordered a copy of the case\u2011file concerning the criminal investigation concerning the events of December 1989. On 31 January 1991 the court held a hearing at which the applicant\u2019s court\u2011appointed lawyer, Mr B.Z., was present. The court stayed the proceedings. On 17 July 1992 the Bia\u0142ystok District Court resumed the proceedings. However, on 12 August 1992 it decided to stay them again in view of the fact that the criminal proceedings against the Governor of the Bia\u0142ystok Remand Centre were pending.\n\n2. Facts after 1 May 1993\n\nOn 29 May 1995 the Bia\u0142ystok District Court resumed the proceedings. The court further decided that the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) was competent to deal with the case.\n\nOn 18 January 1996 the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Court held the first hearing. In January 1997 the applicant was heard before the Trzcianka District Court. Between 18 September and 18 November 1997 the trial court held four hearings.\n\nOn 27 November 1997 the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Court gave judgment. It partly allowed the applicant\u2019s action. The court acknowledged that the applicant had suffered moral damage as a result of the illegal actions of the state agents and awarded him compensation. The Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations that the incident had caused a spinal injury and dismissed the remainder of his claims for compensation.\n\nOn 7 May 1998 the Bia\u0142ystok Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) held a hearing and examined the appeal lodged by the State Treasury. The appellate court gave judgment in which it allowed the State Treasury\u2019s appeal, quashed the impugned judgment, and dismissed the applicant\u2019s action.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant\u2019s court-appointed lawyer refused to lodge a cassation appeal against this judgment on his behalf as he apparently found no legal grounds for it.\n\nB. The second set of civil proceedings\n\n1. Facts before 1 May 1993\n\nOn 28 January 1991 the applicant lodged a civil action for compensation against the State Treasury- Szczecin Remand Centre with the Szczecin Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki). He claimed PLN 2,500 in compensation for an accident which had occurred in 1983, during his detention in the Szczecin Remand Centre. The applicant further complained that the medical treatment he had received at the material time had been inadequate.\n\n2. Facts after 1 May 1993\n\nOn 11 March 1994 the trial court held the first hearing. The applicant, who had been in detention since 1977, was not present at the hearing because he had failed to return to prison from leave. At that hearing, the court stayed the proceedings on the grounds that the applicant\u2019s address could not be established.\n\nOn 20 November 2000 the Szczecin Regional Court resumed the proceedings.\n\nOn 24 April 2001 the trial court held a hearing at which it ordered that an expert opinion be obtained. On 13 December 2001 the court held a second hearing at which it decided that the applicant would be heard by another court since he had been transferred to a different prison. On 11 February 2002 the applicant was heard before the Trzcianka District Court. On 26 March and 7 May 2002 the Szczecin Regional Court held hearings.\n\nOn 24 May 2002 the trial court gave judgment. It dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. The applicant\u2019s court-appointed lawyer lodged an appeal against that judgment.\n\nOn 13 November 2002 the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal allowed his appeal, quashed the Regional Court\u2019s judgment and remitted the case to the first\u2011instance court.\n\nOn 9 June 2004 the Szczecin District Court held a hearing at which it heard the applicant.\n\nOn 21 June 2004 the court, sitting in camera, decided that an expert opinion be prepared. The expert opinion was submitted to the trial court on 27 October 2004.\n\nOn 3 November 2004 the applicant lodged with the Szczecin Regional Court a complaint alleging that his right to have his case examined within a reasonable time had been breached. He submitted that he had lodged a civil action on 28 January 1991 and despite the fact that he had not contributed to their length, the proceedings were still pending before the District Court. The applicant relied on the 2004 Act on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time. At that time, the proceedings were pending before the District Court following the remittal of the case by the appellate court in 2002. According to the 2004 Act the Regional Court \u2013 being the court above the one conducting the impugned proceedings - was competent to examine the complaint (Section 4 \u00a7 1 of the 2004 Act, see the domestic law part below).\n\nOn 7 January 2005 the Szczecin Regional Court dismissed his complaint. The court examined only the course of the proceedings after the remittal of the case by the appellate court on 13 November 2002 and found no delays on the part of the District Court. As result, the court found that during this period the District Court had not violated the applicant\u2019s right to have his case heard within a reasonable time. The Regional Court considered that it could not examine the part of the proceedings that had been pending between 1991 and 2002 before the Regional Court as this part of proceedings had already ended. The court stated: \u201c...The District Court cannot be held responsible for possible delays that might have occurred before the Regional Court during the period between 24 May 1991 when the case was transferred to it and 14 May 2002 when the court gave a judgment... According to the provisions [of the 2004 Act] the Regional Court examining the complaint lodged by [the applicant] that the proceedings in his case before the District Court exceeded a reasonable time is not entitled to examine the course of the proceedings before the Szczecin Regional Court...\u201d\n\nIt appears that the civil proceedings in this case are pending before the Szczecin District Court."}

for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Iranian national, Ms Latife Ahmadpour (Derya Neverdi) (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 14 March 2008.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Baba, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 14 March 2008 the President of the Chamber to which the case was allocated decided, in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the Court, to indicate to the Government of Turkey, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the applicant should not be deported to Iran until the Court comes to a conclusion regarding the application.\n\nOn 18 April 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided that the admissibility and merits of the application would be examined together (Article 29 \u00a7 3) and that the case would be given priority (Rule 41).\n\nThe applicant and the Government each submitted written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1974 and lives in K\u0131rklareli.\n\nA. The applicant's arrival in Turkey and the deportation proceedings\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant was divorced from her husband in Iran. The applicant's ex-husband was appointed the legal guardian of the couple's children.\n\nOn 2 October 2005 the applicant arrived in Turkey with her children, whom she had brought without the consent of her ex-husband. According to her submissions, the applicant had escaped from the violence of her ex-husband. The applicant applied to the national authorities and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (\u201cthe UNHCR\u201d) requesting temporary and permanent asylum soon after her arrival in Turkey.\n\nOn 28 September 2006 the applicant married an Iranian national who had converted to Christianity. In October 2006 the applicant also converted to Christianity.\n\nOn an unspecified date the UNHCR dismissed the applicant's asylum request.\n\nOn 22 December 2006 the applicant and her husband were served with the decisions of the Ministry of Interior rejecting their temporary asylum requests. The Ministry of the Interior considered that the applicant and her husband wished to use the temporary asylum system in Turkey in order to go to a European country where they could improve their financial situation. The applicants were also informed that they had the right to object to the decisions concerned.\n\nOn 7 November 2007 the applicant was informed that she would be deported. On the same day she was granted a residence permit for fifteen days in order to facilitate her departure from Turkey.\n\nOn 15 November 2007 the applicant lodged a case with the Ankara Administrative Court requesting the latter to annul the decision to deport her and to order a stay of execution of that decision pending the proceedings. The applicant also requested legal aid.\n\nOn 30 November 2007 the applicant's request for legal aid was rejected as she was not considered to be in need of it.\n\nOn 2 January 2008 the Sixteenth Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court issued a decision according to which the applicant was required to pay the court fees within thirty days.\n\nOn 18 February 2008 the applicant was placed in the Kumkap\u0131 Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre attached to the Istanbul police headquarters.\n\nThe decision of 2 January 2008 could not be served on the applicant as she could not be found at her place of residence. On 29 February 2008 the administrative court decided to discontinue the proceedings until the applicant informed the court of her new address.\n\nOn 13 March 2008 the UNHCR reopened the applicant's file.\n\nOn 10 April 2008, after being interviewed, the applicant was recognised as a refugee under the mandate of the UNHCR. The UNHCR found credible the applicant's claims that her children had been sexually and physically abused by their father; that she had been subjected to conjugal violence and that she had escaped from Iran in order to save her children and herself. The report of the UNHCR further notes that the applicant's act was punishable under Iranian law. The UNHCR also found that the applicant had married a converted Christian; that she had converted to Christianity and had given birth to a daughter who had been baptised and had a Christian name. Moreover, the applicant was known to be an asylum seeker in Turkey. The UNHCR concluded that the applicant had a well- founded fear of persecution on account of her faith, gender and political opinion, and recognised her as a refugee on the grounds of her political opinion, her membership of a particular social group and her religion.\n\nOn 23 January 2009 the applicant's representative lodged a request with the Sixteenth Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court that the proceedings be resumed and a stay of execution of the deportation decision be ordered.\n\nOn 12 March 2009 the first-instance court decided that there was no need to make a decision regarding the applicant's request for a stay of execution in the light of the Court's indication of an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.\n\nAccording to the information in the case file, the proceedings before the Sixteenth Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court are still pending.\n\nB. The applicant's placement in the Kumkap\u0131 Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre and the related proceedings\n\nOn 18 February 2008 the applicant was placed in the Kumkap\u0131 Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre in Istanbul.\n\nFollowing the indication of the interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the applicant was transferred to the K\u0131rklareli Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre.\n\nOn 29 August 2008 the applicant's representative lodged a request with the Ministry of the Interior for his client and her children to be released and granted residence permits. She received no reply.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant's representative lodged a case with the Ankara Administrative Court. He requested the court to order the release of his client and the children. The lawyer also asked the court to order a stay of execution of the applicant's detention.\n\nOn 15 April 2009 the Sixth Chamber of the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the request for suspension of the administrative decision to hold the applicant and her children in the K\u0131rklareli Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre.\n\nOn 17 June 2009 the Ankara Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's objection to the decision of 15 April 2009.\n\nAccording to the information in the case file, the proceedings before the Sixth Chamber Ankara Administrative Court are still pending.\n\nOn 7 October 2009 the Ministry of the Interior granted residence permits for the applicant and her children for a period of six months in order to allow the applicant's children to continue their education. The applicant and her children were subsequently released from detention. Their residence permits were valid until 7 April 2010.

71342/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet Salih Erin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 13 March 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K. Bilgi\u00e7, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 27 September 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nOn 1 April 2006 this case was assigned to the newly constituted Fifth Section (Rule 25 \u00a7 5 and Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Izmir.\n\nA. Background to the case\n\nOn an unspecified date, police officers at the Istanbul airport arrested two persons in possession of passports containing fake visas. In their statements to the police, these two persons submitted that they had paid 3,000 German marks to the applicant and A.G. in order to have their passports stamped. Consequently, on 29 January 1996 police officers carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s home in the presence of one of his siblings. The police officers seized four passports belonging to the applicant, his sibling and two other persons\n\nOn 6 March 1996 the applicant surrendered to the police. He was then placed in custody.\n\nB. Proceedings before the domestic courts\n\nOn 7 March 1996 the applicant was brought before a single judge at the Izmir Magistrates\u2019 Court who ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 14 March 1996 the Izmir Principle Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Izmir Assize Court charging the applicant with the offence of forging passport, in particular arranging for false visa stamps for travelling abroad.\n\nOn 9 May 1996 the Izmir Assize Court heard the applicant and released him on bail.\n\nOn 30 December 1998, following the qualification of the offence as committed by a criminal organisation, the Izmir Assize Court issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae and sent the case-file to Izmir State Security Court.\n\nOn 11 February 1999 the Izmir State Security Court issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae and referred the case to the Court of Cassation for determination of the competent court.\n\nOn 25 March 1999 the Court of Cassation overturned the Izmir Assize Court\u2019s decision of lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae and held that the offence in question was within the latter\u2019s jurisdiction. The case-file was therefore sent to the Izmir Assize Court.\n\nBetween 22 March 2001 and 3 December 2003 the Izmir Assize Court held eight hearings. All hearings prior to the seventh one, which was held on 5 June 2003, were postponed on the ground that the address of one of the co\u2011accused, namely A.G., could not be found. During this period, the Izmir Assize Court sent five letters to the Izmir Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and requested the latter to find out A.G.\u2019s address.\n\nOn 3 December 2003 the Izmir Assize Court terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant holding that the prosecution was time\u2011barred."}

the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Roman Kozik (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 17 July 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 18 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the excessive length of the applicant\u2019s detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Goleni\u00f3w, Poland.\n\nOn 19 June 2000 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of killing D.L., his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nOn 20 June 2000 the \u015awinouj\u015bcie District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered his detention. It considered that placing the applicant in custody was justified by the existence of strong evidence against him and the gravity of the charges. Since he had attempted to flee, his detention was necessary to ensure the proper course of the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged several times by the Szczecin Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy). Each time the court repeated the reasons it had previously given.\n\nOn 1 March 2001 the applicant lodged an application for release with the \u015awinouj\u015bcie District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy). The prosecutor dismissed the application on 7 March 2001.\n\nOn 26 April 2001 the \u015awinouj\u015bcie District Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Szczecin Regional Court. The applicant was charged with murder (he had strangled his fianc\u00e9e) and fraud.\n\nOn 30 January 2002 the Szczecin Regional Court convicted him as charged and sentenced him to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case on 14 May 2002.\n\nThe applicant remained in custody.\n\nOn 13 June 2002 the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) ordered that the applicant remain in detention until 30 September 2002.\n\nOn 19 June 2002 the court refused his application for release.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant\u2019s detention was extended every 3 months by the Szczecin Regional Court, for the same reasons as before.\n\nThe applicant lodged numerous unsuccessful applications for release with the Regional Court.\n\nOn 7 October 2004 the Szczecin Regional Court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. The court stressed the depraved nature of the crime and maintained that there were no mitigating circumstances in the case.\n\nThe Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment on 29 December 2004.\n\nOn 20 October 2005 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal."}

Austrian national, on 3 November 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 \u00a7 1 and 47 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It originated in an application (no. 30546/96) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 by the applicant. The applicant is represented by Mr R. Gabl, a lawyer practising in Linz (Austria). The Government of Austria are represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Winkler, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s request to the Court referred to Article 48 as amended by Protocol No. 9, which Austria had ratified. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the length of the criminal proceedings against the applicant.\n\nOn 14 January 1999 the Panel of the Grand Chamber decided, pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7 4 of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention and Rules 100 \u00a7 1 and 24 \u00a7 6 of the Rules of Court, that the application would be examined by one of the Sections. It was, thereupon, assigned to the Third Section. Within that Section, the Chamber was constituted in accordance with Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 59 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues of the case. The applicant submitted a memorial on 16 April 1999, and the Government on 17 May 1999.\n\nAfter consulting the Agent of the Government and applicant\u2019s lawyer the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nOn 11 April 1986 preliminary investigations on the suspicion of murder were instituted against the applicant. On 31 March 1987 a Court of Assizes (Geschworenengericht) at the Linz Regional Court (Landesgericht) convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to eighteen years' imprisonment. On 15 September 1987 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) dismissed the applicant's plea of nullity and appeal against sentence.\n\nOn 6 September 1990 the applicant requested the re-opening of the criminal proceedings against him. On 11 December 1991 the Linz Regional Court dismissed the applicant's request. On 15 June 1992 the Linz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) granted the applicant's appeal and reopened the criminal proceedings against him. At the same time the applicant was released.\n\nOn 23 August 1993 the Linz Public Prosecutor's Office filed a bill of indictment charging the applicant with murder. On 7 October 1993 the Linz Court of Appeal accepted the applicant's objections to the indictment.\n\nOn 30 May 1994 the Public Prosecutor's Office filed a new bill of indictment against the applicant. On 9 September 1994 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's objections to it.\n\nOn 6 February 1995 the Supreme Court dismissed a request by the Linz Regional Court to transfer jurisdiction in the case to a court in Vienna.\n\nOn 3 April 1995 the applicant filed a request under Section 91 of the Courts Organisation Act (Gerichtsorganisationsgesetz) with the Linz Court of Appeal. He complained about the inactivity of the Regional Court and requested the Court of Appeal to order the Regional Court to fix a date for the trial. On 24 May 1995 the Court of Appeal refused this request. The Court of Appeal found that the Regional Court had to wait for further expert opinions concerning a DNA test of hair and skin parts which had been found on the victim and the applicant\u2019s clothes.\n\nOn 30 October 1995 the DNA test results were transmitted to the court.\n\nOn 12 February 1996 the Presiding Judge of the Assize Court fixed the date of the applicant's trial for 19 August 1996.\n\nThe applicant's trial commenced on 19 August 1996 and finished on 29 August 1996. On 29 August 1996 the Assize Court acquitted the applicant."}

Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Marcin Bereza (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 18 September 2006.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention had exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 7 February 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nOn 18 December 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder, extortion, robbery and drug trafficking committed while acting as part of an organised criminal group.\n\nOn 23 December 2003 the Warsaw District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. The court indicated that the evidence gathered in the case, in particular the witnesses\u2019 testimonies, showed that there was a strong probability that the applicant had committed the crimes he was suspected of. It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. It further considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence, induce witnesses to give false testimony or go into hiding. In this connection the court stressed that an order for the applicant\u2019s arrest had been issued on 4 September 2000.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s appeal against the detention order, likewise his further appeals against some of the decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful. In his applications and appeals, he argued that his lengthy detention violated the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the applicant\u2019s detention was extended on several occasions, namely on 15 March 2004 (to 17 August 2004), 2 August 2004 (to 17 December 2004), 10 December 2004 (to 2 July 2005) and 7 June 2005 (to 31 October 2005). In all their detention decisions the authorities relied on the original grounds given for the applicant\u2019s detention. The courts stressed that due to the complexity of the case and the large volume of evidence the preparatory proceedings had still not been completed.\n\nOn 17 October 2005 a bill of indictment was lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court. There were 57 defendants in the case, all charged with numerous counts of attempted murder, extortion, robbery, drug trafficking, theft, illegal possession of firearms, battery and forgery committed in an organised criminal group. In the bill of indictment the prosecutor requested the court to hear evidence from 435 witnesses, including 5 key witnesses, and to take another 627 pieces of evidence listed therein.\n\nDuring the court proceedings the authorities further extended the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial on several occasions, namely on 6 October 2005 (to 18 December 2005), 6 December 2005 (to 28 April 2006), 25 April 2006 (to 31 October 2006), 27 October 2006 (to 28 February 2007), 23 February 2007 (to 23 July 2007), 17 July 2007 (to 12 December 2007) and on 19 November 2007 (to 19 March 2008). The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant\u2019s continued detention. They relied especially on the complexity of the case and the large number of co-accused.\n\nOn 3 April 2006 the trial court held the first hearing. It subsequently held some 85 hearings in the case. The proceedings before the Warsaw Regional Court are still pending.\n\nOn an unspecified date in September 2006 the applicant made a written request to the Warsaw Regional Court for the appointment of a new lawyer on the ground that he did not \u201ctrust\u201d G.R, his court-appointed defence counsel.\n\nOn 21 September 2006 G.R. informed the Head of Warsaw Regional Court that the applicant claimed to have lost trust in him as his defence counsel and asked the court to decide whether he should still represent the applicant. It transpires from the file that G.R. remained the applicant\u2019s defence counsel.\n\nOn 4 March 2008 the applicant was released from Detention Centre."}

of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Falter Zeitschriften GmbH, a limited liability company with its registered office in Vienna (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 27 December 2006.\n\nThe applicant company was represented by Mr A.J. Noll, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The Austrian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs.\n\nThe applicant company alleged that a court judgment under the Media Act ordering it to pay damages had infringed its right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nOn 29 January 2009 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant company is the owner and publisher of the weekly newspaper Falter.\n\nA. The background to the case\n\nOn 2 May 2005 the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court, sitting as a court with two professional and two lay judges (Sch\u00f6ffengericht) under Presiding Judge I.K., acquitted H.P., a security officer at the Traiskirchen Reception Centre, of a charge of raping K., an asylum seeker from Cameroon, basing its ruling on the principle of in dubio pro reo.\n\nThe reasoning of the judgment contained the following passage: \u201cLastly, the statement made by witness K. during her examination [recorded on video tape in a separate room \u2013 kontradiktorische Einvernahme], to the effect that she had previously been engaged in prostitution in her country of origin, allows inferences to be drawn with regard to the statement by the accused [P.] that the witness might have become involved with him because she expected \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 to gain some advantage.\u201d\n\nB. The article published by the applicant company\n\nIn issue no. 19/05 of Falter, an article was published on page 14 concerning the criminal proceedings against P., which read as follows: \u201c\u2018Sex with a nigger woman\u2019 The courts: An asylum seeker lodges a criminal complaint alleging rape against a security officer. The case takes on a political dimension because it exposes conditions in the Traiskirchen centre. One year later only the victim is still before the courts. The chronicling of a judicial scandal.\n\nF. K.\n\nShe thought she had made it to safety. Elaine B. (name changed, ed.) had been ill-treated by police officers in Cameroon, kicked by them in the abdomen and placed with 18 other women in \u2018stinking, damp cells\u2019 for having demonstrated on behalf of her son, abducted by the authorities. She had survived her escape on a container ship, during which she \u2018nearly went mad\u2019 because in mid-ocean she \u2018no longer knew whether it was night or day outside\u2019. Finally, after a lorry journey lasting several days, she found herself in Vienna, where all at once, she was \u2018surrounded by white people\u2019. She thought she was safe. Her case was so well documented that Austria, in the form of the normally very strict Federal Refugee Office, granted her asylum quickly and without red tape. But then this country revealed its other side. Elaine B., 35, a well-groomed businesswoman and mother of three, holds on tight to her handbag during the interview and breaks down in tears repeatedly, says her life is a mess [and that] she can no longer trust the authorities here because they treat her like a liar and a prostitute. Elaine B. caused a media stir last year when she became the first asylum seeker to lodge a complaint against a blind-drunk security officer who she claims abused his authority in the Traiskirchen centre in order to rape her. Now she faces trial for defamation. A few fellow Cameroonians, as well as the campaigning lawyer W.R. and his colleague R.H., are continuing to stand by her. \u2018Otherwise I would have killed myself\u2019, says Elaine. It\u2019s difficult to know where to begin in this case. With the then Interior Minister E.S. who, while the proceedings were in progress, told the National Assembly that the woman\u2019s accusations were \u2018unfounded\u2019? With the company European Homecare, engaged by him, which ostensibly ran the centre on a much smaller budget than Caritas, but in fact used sub\u2011contractors employing drunken nightwatchmen who had to be dismissed for sexual assault? With centre director F.S., who later commented on the attacks in the washrooms of the women\u2019s quarters by telling the court: \u2018According to our information such incidents are very common and no one thinks anything of them\u2019? Or with Judge I.K., who at the end of the drama would no longer \u2018refute\u2019 the suggestion that Elaine B. was just a \u2018prostitute\u2019 \u2013 although not even the accused security officer claimed that that was the case? Spring 2004. With a thousand asylum seekers, Traiskirchen is hopelessly over\u00adcrowded. Another hundred arrive every day. The Interior Ministry is coming under political pressure and discredits Caritas. Security officers at the centre later state in court that female asylum seekers could be paid for quick sex. They also tell of pimps rolling up to the centre in their cars. The sexual exploitation seems to have been unbearable. In a series of articles for profil, a female journalist published an email and statements from several women complaining of sexual assaults by security staff. \u2018Please help us!\u2019 pleaded the women. The Interior Ministry stated at the time that the police were confronted with a \u2018wall of silence\u2019. At that time Elaine B. from Cameroon demanded an interview with the head of the Traiskirchen [branch of the] Gendarmerie. She placed a pair of torn red underpants on the interview room table and described \u2018through her tears\u2019 how a drunken security officer had pursued her for days, pointing to his uniform and threatening to have her thrown out of the centre and to slit her throat. One night he had crept into the room, switched on the light and told her to go with him. Elaine B., who had not yet been granted asylum and feared his authority, wrapped a towel around herself and followed the uniformed officer into the office, where there was a bed and a roll of kitchen towel. He had prepared the kitchen towel for \u2018ejaculating into\u2019, as he later admitted. \u2018At first I didn\u2019t realise what the man wanted. I thought I\u2019d done something wrong. But there in that room I realised that he was going to rape me\u2019, stated Elaine B. She could smell the drink on his breath and didn\u2019t dare cry out. The practising Christian from Cameroon is called upon to describe the incident many more times in the most intimate detail, without contradicting herself. She describes with precision how the man locked the door and removed the key. She tells of the pains in her lower abdomen afterwards and how she washed herself with warm water for weeks. She immediately identifies the security officer in a photo. The officials record in the minutes that Elaine B. appears disturbed. \u2018We were in no doubt that it happened as she described it. The woman was intimidated and seemed very anxious\u2019, recalls District Inspector W.S., who investigated the case, a year later in court. His statement, like that of the victim, is disregarded. Disturbing errors occur. For the first interview in the interview room no trained interpreter can be found; moreover, the traumatised woman is initially interviewed by a man. In their minutes the police officers at times refer to Elaine B. not by her name but as \u2018the nigger woman\u2019. She is repeatedly linked to prostitution.\n\nH.P., 48, is interviewed as the presumed perpetrator. When first questioned the trained bricklayer with the thick moustache states: \u2018I didn\u2019t have sex with the nigger woman.\u2019 The next time his recall is more accurate: \u2018It\u2019s possible that I had intercourse with the nigger woman. I\u2019d had twelve and a half litres of beer and one and a half litres of herb lemonade mixed with red wine.\u2019 He claims it was entirely consensual. However, he doesn\u2019t recognise Elaine in a photo. Police officer: \u2018Could the woman have left the room if she\u2019d wanted to?\u2019 Answer: \u2018No, only I had a key\u2019. Again the question: \u2018Did you pay the nigger woman for sexual intercourse?\u2019 Answer: \u2018No way!\u2019 Third [interview] record: \u2018I\u2019d noticed the nigger woman about a week before we had sex. I fancied her from the beginning. I went into her room and gestured to her to come out.\u2019 According to him, she followed him out of her own accord, undressed in front of him, took hold of his penis, inserted it and then got dressed again. Then she disappeared for good \u2013 without making any demands. \u2018Maybe she thought she\u2019d be given asylum sooner\u2019 speculates the security officer. Something else occurs to him. He had offered to buy the woman a drink in the bakery a few days before. She had stroked his back and \u2018cosied up\u2019 to him.\n\nElaine B. denies this version of events. She says that she had other things on her mind at the time. She is not a whore. She felt repelled by this fat man with a moustache who smelled of alcohol, she was afraid of him. Also: if she had really been hoping to be granted asylum, why would she then have defamed the security officer? Next to take the witness stand are the employees of the bakery. The first to be examined is saleswoman R.Z.: \u2018She gave him a kiss. She was fairly young, I\u2019d say between 20 and 25. The two of them were talking quietly. I couldn\u2019t describe the woman.\u2019 When confronted with Elaine B. Z. says: \u2018I\u2019m not quite sure whether it\u2019s her.\u2019 At the second confrontation a year later she suddenly says: \u2018Yes, that\u2019s her!\u2019 She has something else to get off her chest: \u2018I have to say that we\u2019re losing a lot of customers because of the black Africans. It\u2019s bad for business!\u2019 Likewise the second saleswoman. The first time she gives evidence: \u2018I\u2019m not sure\u2019. The second time: \u2018I\u2019m 99 per cent certain.\u2019 Elaine B. is 35 years old and speaks neither German nor English \u2013 only French. The quiet talk described could not have taken place. One detail, however, is never mentioned: at the time, the bakery was delivering tens of thousands of bread rolls to the reception centre. The Wiener Neustadt Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which sees the Africans from Traiskirchen most often in connection with drug dealing, wants to discontinue the proceedings on the basis of the statements by the bakery employees. Elaine\u2019s lawyer, W.R., then brings a \u2018subsidiary private prosecution\u2019 (Subsidiaranklage) before the Court of Appeal. The victim can take over the role of the public prosecutor at his or her own risk. The unexpected happens: the Court of Appeal finds in the woman\u2019s favour and orders the Justice Ministry to prosecute the security officer. \u2018As the case file currently stands, both the factual element of the offence of rape and the element of coercion appear to be made out beyond doubt\u2019, states the judgment. According to the court, the bakery employees could not have identified Elaine. The trial with judges and lay assessors before Wiener Neustadt Criminal Court does not last long. No evidence is taken either from other asylum seekers or from the female staff in the women\u2019s quarters. Judge I.K. acquits the security officer. Of course, if she has doubts as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, she has to do so. But this judge and her lay assessors are in no doubt as to the woman\u2019s guilt. They have unfinished business with the African woman and attribute the basest intentions to her \u2013 without furnishing any proof. The reasoning is diametrically opposed to that of the Court of Appeal: \u2018It cannot be established that the accused performed sexual intercourse against the will of Elaine B.\u2019 And what of the statements of the bakery employees, called into question by the Court of Appeal? \u2018Clear proof\u2019 that Elaine B. had also been lying about the sexual encounter. The fact that the bakery employees got her age wrong by ten to fifteen years? \u2018The difficulty of correctly estimating the age of persons with a different skin colour is known to the courts.\u2019 And the constantly changing replies of the security officer? \u2018He is a very simple man\u2019 and it therefore spoke in his favour \u2018that he himself admitted that intercourse with the witness was not easy to achieve.\u2019 The \u2018black African\u2019 on the other hand, appeared \u2018very confident\u2019, with the result that \u2018it is hard to imagine that she could have felt so intimidated by the accused, who appears somewhat unsure of himself, that she left her quarters against her will.\u2019 And what of the only piece of physical evidence, the torn red underpants? \u2018These have no evidentiary value\u2019 according to Judge K. Why not? Because the accused said that the underpants had been \u2018beige\u2019. Not another word from the detectives who had been faced with a crying, completely intimidated woman. No mention of the fact that the security officer himself admitted locking Elaine in [the room] and removing the key. Not a single line about the predicament in which female asylum seekers found themselves at the time. Complete understanding, on the other hand, for the accused: \u2018The accused\u2019s objection that the woman may have hoped, since her asylum claim had not been decided, to obtain Austrian citizenship by marrying him, has not been completely refuted\u2019. Even if this were true, why would she then lodge a complaint against him two weeks later? The judgment fails to give rise to a scandal. \u2018Flirtation in Traiskirchen\u2019 runs the title in the Kurier. Then, what women\u2019s shelters have been complaining of for years happens: the woman becomes the presumed perpetrator. With the approval of Justice Minister K.M., the principal public prosecutor\u2019s office institutes preliminary proceedings for defamation. Elaine B. must appear before the investigating judge \u2018or be brought by force\u2019. She could face up to five years in prison. \u2018That\u2019s just routine, nothing unusual\u2019 says a Justice Ministry spokesman. According to principal public prosecutor P.: \u2018After [the] acquittal we have no choice but to initiate proceedings.\u2019 Justice Minister K.M. has promised to do more to protect the victims of crime. She should study this case. She is the highest-ranking public prosecutor. She has the right to give instructions. She bears the political responsibility if this woman, in addition to everything else, faces charges.\u201d\n\nC. The compensation proceedings under the Media Act\n\nSubsequently, Judge I.K. brought an action for defamation against the applicant company under section 6 of the Media Act and Article 111 of the Criminal Code, and requested that the applicant company be ordered to pay compensation and retract the following statements made in the article, which she claimed amounted to a statement that she had grossly misused her office as a judge: \u201cJudge I.K. alleges that the asylum seeker had immoral motives.\u201d Judge I.K. alleges in the judgment \u2013 without giving any reasons \u2013 that the asylum seeker was driven by the basest motives. \u201cJudge I.K. acquits the security officer. Of course, if she has doubts as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, she has to do so. But this judge and her lay assessors are in no doubt as to the woman\u2019s guilt. They have unfinished business with the African woman and attribute the basest intentions to her \u2013 without furnishing any proof.\u201d Judge I.K. had no doubt about the woman\u2019s guilt. The judge ignored relevant evidence and delivered a scandalous judgment (\u201cThe judgment fails to give rise to a scandal.\u201d)\n\nOn 1 September 2005 the first hearing in the defamation proceedings was held. The applicant company argued that the impugned statements were true and sought to prove the truth of those statements by asking the court to call several witnesses and admit as evidence the files of the proceedings concerning K.\u2019s asylum request and the criminal proceedings against H.P. It considered that by publishing the impugned statements it had merely expressed criticism, protected by the freedom of speech, which had not concerned the acquittal itself but rather the way in which the victim of the crime had been treated in the written version of the judgment, which had neglected important evidence and had accused the victim, K., of having been a prostitute.\n\nIn October 2005 the applicant company sought the disqualification of Judge N.F., the judge assigned to the media proceedings, for bias. It submitted that the lawyer representing the claimant, I.K., had also represented N.F. in the past in court proceedings. As Judge N.F. had to decide on a case in which her previous lawyer was acting as representative of one of the parties, there was reasonable doubt that she would not decide the case objectively. The president of the Vienna Regional Court dismissed the motion on 17 October 2005 and held that the issue raised by the applicant was not sufficient to give rise to doubt that Judge N.F. would not decide the case objectively.\n\nOn 17 October 2005 a further hearing was held in the defamation proceedings. The hearing was adjourned in order to hear three witnesses proposed by the applicant company. The Regional Court refused to hear other witnesses proposed by the applicant company, as it considered that those persons could not make any statements relevant to the proceedings. The applicant company had sought to call R., who had been K.\u2019s lawyer in the criminal proceedings, in order to clarify the meaning of statements that K. had given during her examination as a witness which had been recorded on video in order to prevent her as the victim having to face the accused (kontra\u00addiktorische Einvernahme). This request was refused by the Regional Court on the grounds that the transcript of K.\u2019s examination had been included in the case file and therefore no additional witness was required.\n\nOn 12 December 2005 the Regional Court held another hearing in the defamation proceedings in which it examined two of the witnesses proposed by the applicant company. The third witness proposed did not appear. On the same date the Regional Court found against the applicant company. It held that the impugned statements had constituted defamation under Article 111 of the Criminal Code and that I.K. was therefore entitled to compensation, which it set at 7,000 euros (EUR). It also ordered the applicant company to publish a summary of the judgment.\n\nThe Regional Court found that the contents of the article had given a biased account of the taking of evidence at the trial of H.P., taking the side of K. and characterising any statement of a witness which did not coincide with hers as lacking credibility. According to the article, the judge had acted arbitrarily and out of racist motives and had disregarded evidence produced, whereas the rape asserted by K. had been described as proven and the assessment of evidence by the Regional Court as absurd. Such an account was not an objective critique of the judgment.\n\nAs regards the criminal proceedings against H.P., the Regional Court observed that: (a) they had been discontinued by the Public Prosecutor; and (b) upon a subsequent decision by the Senior Public Prosecutor H.P. had been committed for trial (Versetzung in den Anklagestand). Following three hearings at which a total of seven witnesses had been heard, the tape recording of the questioning of the victim had been viewed in part by the court and a confrontation between two witnesses and K. had taken place, the court had acquitted the accused.\n\nIn its judgment of 2 May 2005 the court had found that it could not be excluded that the sexual intercourse which had taken place between K. and the accused had been consensual, in accordance with the version of events given by the accused and which had, to some extent, been corroborated by the statements of witnesses who had seen the accused and K. together in a coffee shop in town. K.\u2019s assertion that she had been the victim of an assault had not been excluded but because it contradicted the statements of witnesses it had been considered to be partially implausible. The accused had not therefore been acquitted because his innocence had been proven but rather on the basis of the principle of in dubio pro reo.\n\nThe Regional Court also referred to one passage of the written judgment on which the article had put much emphasis, namely a reference to a statement by K. made in the course of her questioning as a witness to the effect that she had previously been engaged in prostitution in her country of origin, which the judgment stated had allowed inferences to be drawn with regard to the statement by the accused that the witness might have become involved with him because she expected \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 to gain some advantage.\n\nThe Regional Court found that the applicant company had not succeeded in proving the truth of the impugned statements. From the case file concerning the proceedings against H.P. and, in particular, the written version of the judgment it appeared that Judge I.K. had dealt with all the evidence taken and had assessed each item of evidence extensively. Therefore, it could not be established that Judge I.K. had made base insinuations (\u00fcble Unterstellungen) or disregarded evidence. The judgment had clearly indicated the court\u2019s reluctance to accept the version of events given by K. also. In addition, the indication of K. having been a prostitute in the past had been based on a statement from the questioning of that witness and had not been made up out of thin air. The relevant part of the transcript in question read as follows: [Original] \u201cUntersuchungsrichter: Es gibt einen Zeugen. Er sagt aus: \u201cim Haus Nr. 8 gibt es Frauen die auf den Strich gehen.\u201d Wissen Sie was davon? Zeugin: Keine Ahnung, ich nicht, nein. Seit meiner Heimat habe ich es nie gewagt.\u201d [English translation] \u201cInvestigating judge: There is one witness. He said: \u201cat no. 8 there are women who walk the streets.\u201d Do you know anything about it? Witness K.: No idea, not me, no. Since leaving my country I haven\u2019t dared it.\u201d An error in the translation of that statement could not be excluded, but that did not allow the conclusion that there had been no basis in the file for the above finding of Judge I.K.\n\nThe accusation that a judge, who was under the duty to act objectively and impartially, had without any factual basis and out of racist motives deliberately disregarded evidence in order to acquit an accused from the same country (inl\u00e4ndischen Angeklagten) had to be qualified as defamation and there was hardly a more severe accusation which could be levied against a judge. The term scandal of justice was a value judgement, which, however, was based on assertions of fact which had been disproven in the proceedings.\n\nInsofar as the applicant company had relied on Article 10 of the Convention, the Regional Court referred to the case of Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria (26 April 1995, Series A no. 313), and observed that the press had the right and the duty to impart information on matters of public interest, including questions concerning the functioning of the justice system, and to criticise any shortcomings found, but in doing so it had to be mindful of the special role of the judiciary in society. It was therefore necessary to protect public confidence in the judiciary against destructive attacks that were essentially unfounded. Taking these principles into account, the sharp critique of Judge I.K. in the impugned article, which had lacked any sufficient factual basis, had been excessive.\n\nTaking the gravity of the attacks on the claimant\u2019s professional reputation, the broad public attention the article had received and the consequences it had had for the claimant, the Regional Court found that the amount of EUR 7,000 in compensation was appropriate.\n\nThe applicant company appealed on 8 March 2006 against the Regional Court\u2019s judgment. On 19 June 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment. This judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s company lawyer on 29 June 2006."}

Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by four Polish nationals, Stefania Ha\u0142ka (\u201cthe first applicant\u201d) and her three daughters Ma\u0142gorzata Rudecka (\u201cthe second applicant\u201d), Anna Rusak (\u201cthe third applicant\u201d), Wies\u0142awa Ha\u0142ka-Bogda\u0144ska (\u201cthe fourth applicant\u201d) (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 15 March 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The applicants were, exceptionally, granted leave to be represented by the fourth applicant (Rule 36 \u00a7 4 of the Rules of Court). The latter was also granted leave to use the Polish language in the proceedings before the Court (Rule 34 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court).\n\nThe applicants alleged, in particular, that their right to a \u201chearing within a reasonable time\u201d had not been respected.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. On 23 October 2001 the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. It also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first and the second applicant were born in 1927 and 1950 respectively. The third and the fourth applicant were born in 1954. The first applicant lives in J\u00f3zef\u00f3w and her three daughters in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nFrom 1939 to 1944, Jan Ha\u0142ka, the first applicant's husband, was a member of the Polish resistance troops of the underground Home Army (Armia Krajowa). In 1944 he was arrested by the NKVD and the Polish political police and imprisoned in a labour camp in Siberia. He was kept in Borowice (former USSR) from November 1944 to February 1946. He died on 17 November 1986.\n\nOn 8 December 1994 the applicants filed an application with the Warsaw Regional Court for compensation under section 8 \u00a7 2(a) of the Law of 23 February 1991 on annulment of convictions whereby persons were persecuted for their activities aimed at achieving independence for Poland (Ustawa o uznaniu za niewa\u017cne orzecze\u0144 wydanych wobec os\u00f3b represjonowanych za dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 na rzecz niepodleg\u0142ego buty Pa\u0144stwa Polskiego) (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d).\n\nIn 1996 the first applicant personally went to the court and asked a judge to fix a date for a hearing as soon as possible. She submitted that she was an elderly person and that the court should therefore give priority to her case.\n\nIn 1998 she again went in person to the Warsaw Regional Court and asked the judge to set a date for a hearing as soon as possible.\n\nOn 11 May 2000 she sent a letter to the court, asking for a hearing date to be set and for information on the proceedings. She maintained that her previous applications for the proceedings to be accelerated had been to no avail and that the period of total inactivity on the part of that court had exceeded five years.\n\nOn 1 October 2000 she complained to the Minister of Justice about the lack of progress in the proceedings.\n\nOn 4 December 2000 the Warsaw Regional Court held a hearing in the applicants' case. On the same date the court gave judgment and awarded the first applicant and her three daughters compensation in the amount of 8,075 Polish zlotys (PLN) each. Since no party appealed within the statutory time-limit of seven days, the first-instance decision became final on 12 December 2000.\n\nOn 19 March 2002 the Warsaw Regional Court informed the first and the third applicant that they could collect the sums awarded from the Financial Department of the Warsaw Regional Court on 25 March 2002. They did so. It appears from the material produced by the applicants that the second and the fourth applicant have not yet received their share of the compensation awarded."}

Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mrs Michalina Kruk (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 2 October 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agents, Ms S. Jaczewska, and subsequently, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 9 October 2003 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1939 and lives in O\u0142drzychowice, Poland.\n\nA. Facts before 1 May 1993\n\nOn 2 April 1985 the applicant applied to the Wroc\u0142aw District Commission for Mining Damages (Okr\u0119gowa Komisja do spraw Szk\u00f3d G\u00f3rniczych) for compensation for damage caused to her house.\n\nOn 25 September 1985 the Commission dismissed her application.\n\nThe applicant appealed against this decision. Subsequently, on 7 July 1987 the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny S\u0105d Administracyjny) and on 24 August 1988 the Appellate Commission for Mining Damage (Odwo\u0142awcza Komisja do spraw Szk\u00f3d G\u00f3rniczych) quashed previous decisions given in the case.\n\nOn 7 April 1992 the District Commission for Mining Damage gave its decision in which it partly allowed the applicant\u2019s action. The applicant appealed against this decision.\n\nB. Facts after 1 May 1993\n\nOn 8 December 1993 the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Commission held a hearing.\n\nOn 2 September 1994 a new law entered into force which provided that the civil courts would be competent to examine applications for compensation for mining damage and abolished the Commission for Mining Damage (Ustawa z dnia 4 lutego 1994, Prawo geologiczne i g\u00f3rnicze).\n\nAccordingly, the applicant\u2019s case was transferred to the \u015awidnica Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki).\n\nThe first hearing was held on 24 April 1995. The court ordered that an expert opinion be prepared. The opinion was submitted to the court on 26 April 1996.\n\nSubsequently, hearings were held on 18 November 1996, 17 March and 19 September 1997, 13 February 1998 and 10 February 1999. The court ordered several new expert opinions.\n\nOn 17 February 1999 the \u015awidnica Regional Court gave judgment in which it dismissed the applicant\u2019s action.\n\nOn 10 March 1999 the applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment.\n\nOn 11 May 1999 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 1 October 1999 the \u015awidnica Regional Court held a hearing. The trial court ordered that new expert opinions be prepared. The hearing scheduled for 19 January 2000 was adjourned.\n\nAt the hearing held on 16 February 2000 the \u015awidnica Regional Court gave judgment. The court partly allowed the applicant\u2019s action and granted her compensation.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment.\n\nOn 31 May 2000 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal."}

of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Erdal K\u0131ran (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 9 April 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. \u00c7akmak, a lawyer practising in Van. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his right of access to court was breached by the domestic court\u2019s refusal of his legal aid request.\n\nOn 25 May 2010 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1987 and lives in Van.\n\nIn 2008, during his military service, the applicant was disbanded from the army as he was diagnosed with a psychotic illness by the Van Military Hospital.\n\nSubsequently, on 7 October 2008 he initiated compensation proceedings, claiming that he had become ill during his military service as a result of the degrading treatment he had been subjected to in the army. He claimed that he had been healthy before and that the Ministry of Defence had failed to provide medical treatment for his condition. The applicant requested a total of 150,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 80,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, submitting the medical records from the Van Military Hospital in support of his claims. He also requested legal aid for the court fees, presenting a certificate from the office of the headman (muhtar) attesting to his poverty.\n\nOn 28 October 2008 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant\u2019s legal aid request, after having stated that pursuant to the Code on Civil Procedure, a legal aid request must be supported by proof that the case is well-founded and that the plaintiff does not have the means to pay the required court fees. The court concluded that the requirements were not met in the applicant\u2019s case.\n\nOn 31 October 2008 the court informed the applicant that he was to pay a total of TRY 2,384 (approximately EUR 1,300) in court fees within thirty days for the proceedings to be continued.\n\nOn 4 February 2009 the Supreme Military Administrative Court decided to discontinue the compensation proceedings because the applicant had not paid the necessary court fees."}

under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ramazan Balaban (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 8 November 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs N. Bener, a lawyer practising in Bursa. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 5 June 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant, the non-communication of the principal public prosecutor\u2019s observations before the Court of Cassation, the lack of a public hearing in the determination of his compensation claim and the alleged damage he suffered as a result of the domestic court\u2019s failure to order payment of interest to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Bursa.\n\nA. The criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 17 October 1996 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of complicity in an armed robbery and homicide in Bursa.\n\nOn 27 October 1996 he was detained on remand.\n\nOn 4 November 1996 the Bursa public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Bursa Assize Court, charging the applicant and three others with the murder of M.T. and armed robbery.\n\nOn 21 November 1997 the Bursa Assize Court acquitted the applicant and two of his co-accused. The fourth accused, A.\u015e., was convicted. The first-instance court ordered the applicant\u2019s release from prison.\n\nThe Bursa public prosecutor, M.T.\u2019s father, who had joined the proceedings before the Bursa Assize Court, and A.\u015e. appealed.\n\nOn an unspecified date the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion (tebli\u011fname) on the merits of the appeal. This opinion was not served on the applicant.\n\nOn 28 April 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 21 November 1997, holding that the first-instance court had failed to collect certain relevant evidence. The case was remitted to the Bursa Assize Court.\n\nOn 29 June 2001 the Bursa Assize Court once again acquitted the applicant and two of his co-accused after gathering the evidence mentioned in the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision. In its judgment, it held that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant had committed the offences in question.\n\nThe Bursa public prosecutor, M.T.\u2019s father and A.\u015e. again appealed. On an unspecified date the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion (tebli\u011fname) on the merits of the appeal. This opinion was not served on the applicant.\n\nOn 19 March 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 29 June 2001. This decision was recorded in the records held by the Registry of the Bursa Assize Court on 17 April 2002.\n\nB. The compensation proceedings\n\nOn 6 August 2002 the applicant brought an action in the Bursa Assize Court for compensation under Law no. 466 for his detention between 17 October 1996 and 2 November 1997.\n\nOn 20 August 2002 the court held a hearing and appointed one of its members as judge rapporteur to investigate the case and draft a report. There is no indication that the applicant and/or his legal representative were duly notified of this hearing. The rapporteur held investigatory sittings between 30 September 2002 and 23 December 2002. There is no indication that the applicant and/or his legal representative were summoned to be heard by the rapporteur during this time.\n\nOn 24 December 2002 the Bursa Assize Court held a hearing and, relying on the expert report and the documents contained in the case file, awarded the applicant 195,680,000 (TRL) (approximately EUR 116) for pecuniary damage and TRL 3,000,000,000 (approximately EUR 1,791) for non-pecuniary damage. In determining the award of pecuniary damage, the court referred to the minimum wage at the time and the applicant\u2019s loss of income during his incarceration. With respect to non-pecuniary damage, it took into account the applicant\u2019s socio-economic position, the seriousness of the charges brought against him, the time he had spent in detention and the intensity of his emotional suffering. It further awarded the applicant an amount for costs and expenses incurred before the criminal court. However, it dismissed his request for interest running from the date of his release, holding that interest could not be awarded in cases brought under Law no. 466. There is no indication that the applicant and/or his legal representative were duly notified of this hearing.\n\nOn 31 March and 6 February 2003 the Treasury and the applicant appealed. The applicant complained, inter alia, about the absence of an oral hearing before the Bursa Assize Court and the refusal to fix an interest rate for the compensation awarded to him.\n\nOn 10 June 2003 the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion on the merits of the appeals. He advised that the judgment of the first-instance court should be quashed as it had failed, inter alia, to take statements from the applicant in person before awarding him compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 2 July 2003 this opinion was served on the applicant.\n\nOn 12 May 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Bursa Assize Court. In its decision the court also noted that there had been no need for an oral hearing in the case.\n\nThe Government stated that on 3 November 2004 the authorities paid the amount due."}

the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Nuri Akal\u0131n (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 10 May 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms \u0130. Kadirhan and Ms G. Tuncer, lawyers practising in \u0130stanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 19 May 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (former Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1977 and detained in Kand\u0131ra prison.\n\nOn 3 March 1997 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being a member of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 14 March 1997 the applicant was examined by a doctor. The medical report drawn up by the doctor indicated that there was hyperaemia on the applicant's thighs.\n\nOn the same day the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor, where he stated that he had been stripped and hosed with water under police custody.\n\nOn the same day the judge at the \u0130stanbul State Security Court ordered his pre-trial detention. Before the judge the applicant stated that his statement in police custody had been taken under torture, but he did not give any details.\n\nOn 28 April 1997 the public prosecutor at the \u0130stanbul State Security Court issued an indictment charging the applicant with attempting to undermine the constitutional order under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn 7 July 1997 the applicant stated before the \u0130stanbul State Security Court that his statement in police custody had been taken under torture, without giving any details.\n\nOn 26 April 2002 the \u0130stanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn 12 May 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 26 April 2002.\n\nBy Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Gazette on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished. The case against the applicant was subsequently resumed before the \u0130stanbul Assize Court.\n\nOn 25 December 2008 and 9 April 2009 the applicant objected to his continued detention and requested his release. The 11th Chamber of the \u0130stanbul Assize Court dismissed the applicant's objections on 14 January and 15 April 2009 respectively, having regard to the nature of the offence in question and to the state of the evidence. No hearing was held.\n\nOn 2 April 2009 the \u0130stanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant.\n\nAccording to information in the case file, the case is pending before the Court of Cassation.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the first instance courts examined the applicant's continued detention at the end of each hearing, either on their own motion or upon the applicant's requests. Each time the courts ordered the applicant's continued detention having regard to the state of the evidence, the nature of the offence, the strong suspicion of his having committed the offence in issue, the danger of flight, the overall period of the pre-trial detention, and the persistence of the grounds for the continued detention."}

(\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ertu\u011frul Dinleten (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 21 November 1995.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Sami Alptekin, a lawyer practising in \u0130zmir (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr R\u0131za T\u00fcrmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaint (applications nos. 28291/95, 29280/95, 26700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32964/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 \u00a7 2).\n\nBy a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties\u2019 observations, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Arrest and detention of the applicant\n\nOn 26 June 1979 police officers from the \u0130zmir Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the THKP-C (Turkish People\u2019s Liberation Party/Front).\n\nOn 29 June 1979 the applicant was detained on remand.\n\nB. Trial in the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court\n\nOn 4 March 1981 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court against the applicant and 127 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation, namely the THKP/C, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. He further charged the applicant with having been involved in a number of crimes such as killing of foreign military officers, bombing and opening fire on security forces, organising and participating in illegal meetings.\n\nThe prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.\n\nIn a judgment of 8 November 1984 the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the THKP/C and his involvement in some of the alleged crimes. It sentenced the applicant to lifetime imprisonment under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.\n\nC. Proceedings on appeal\n\nAs the applicant\u2019s sentence exceeded 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, his case was automatically referred to the Military Court of Cassation (Askeri Yarg\u0131tay).\n\nOn 12 April 1988 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction on the grounds that the first instance court failed to establish the applicant\u2019s involvement in certain of the alleged crimes. It referred the case to the Istanbul Martial Law Court.\n\nOn 17 August 1990 the Istanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to lifetime imprisonment, permanently debarred him from employment in the civil service and placed him under judicial guardianship. The court ordered the applicant\u2019s release pending trial on the same day. The applicant appealed.\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (Yarg\u0131tay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 4 January 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.\n\nOn 18 April 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction."}

Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr J\u00f3zef Niewiadomski (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 14 June 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 26 August 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1933 and lives in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland.\n\nA. The facts prior to 1 May 1993\n\nIn 1983 the Government decided to construct the Polish Mothers' Memorial Hospital (\u201cthe hospital\u201d) in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, the largest obstetric and paediatric hospital in the country. At the same time the Citizens' Council (\u201cthe Council\u201d) of the hospital was established. It was responsible for fund-raising and oversight of the hospital's construction. The applicant served as a secretary general of the Council.\n\nOn 16 February 1991 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Prosecutor charged the applicant and three other members of the Council with embezzlement of the hospital funds.\n\nOn 13 July 1992 the Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court against the applicant and three other co-accused.\n\nOn 12 November 1992 the Regional Court sent the case back to the prosecution service for additional investigation. The prosecution appealed unsuccessfully against that decision. On 31 December 1992 the Regional Prosecutor discontinued the investigation in respect of certain charges.\n\nB. The facts after 1 May 1993\n\nOn 14 December 1993 an amended bill of indictment against the applicant and two other defendants was lodged with the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court. The applicant was charged with embezzlement of funds allocated to the Council.\n\nThe Regional Court held 11 hearings on the following dates: 16 and 17 May, 4 and 5 October 1994; 4 and 17 January, 14 February, 20 March and 12, 26 and 27 April 1995. It heard an unspecified number of witnesses and experts. Seven hearings were adjourned, including two on account of the judge's illness and one at the prosecutor's request. Other hearings appear to have been adjourned due to the failure of certain witnesses to appear.\n\nOn 4 May 1995 the Regional Court acquitted the applicant. The prosecution appealed against that judgment on 22 August 1995.\n\nA hearing before the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal scheduled for 14 February 1996 was adjourned since one of the judges could not be present. On 15 March 1996 the Court of Appeal quashed the acquittal and remitted the case.\n\nA hearing scheduled for 10 January 1997 had to be adjourned on account of the illness of H.A. (one of the defendants). On 14 March 1997 the Regional Court stayed the proceedings on that ground. On 13 August 1997 the proceedings were resumed, after the Regional Court had obtained additional medical reports concerning H.A.\n\nA hearing before the Regional Court scheduled for 6 October 1997 had to be adjourned due to the illness of I.C., one of the defendants. On 18 November 1997 the Regional Court made a severance order in respect of the proceedings against I.C.\n\nThe Regional Court held three hearings on the following dates: 26 March, 25 May and 4 June 1998. Four hearings had to be adjourned due to the applicant's absence. Three of those related to the fact that the applicant had had a heart attack and had to be hospitalised. One hearing was adjourned since the judge was on leave.\n\nOn 27 November 1998 the Regional Prosecutor requested the trial court to discontinue the proceedings. The applicant's lawyer supported that request.\n\nOn 30 December 1998 the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings against the applicant, pursuant to Article 17 \u00a7 1 subparagraph 2 of the new Criminal Code, which entered into force on 1 September 1998. It held that the acts with which the applicant had been charged did not constitute an offence under the new Criminal Code.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal against that decision.\n\nThe applicant also submits that throughout the trial many press articles had been published which showed him in a negative light and had had a bearing on the principle of the presumption of innocence."}

Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Ms Gra\u017cyna Kaniewska (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 5 February 2008.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 12 March 2009 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nOn 24 July 2009 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike out the application, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\n1. Facts prior to 1 May 1993\n\nOn 22 March 1993 the applicant's mother lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) a claim for a declaration that a notarial deed was null and void (in the framework of inheritance proceedings). The action was instituted against five defendants.\n\n2. Facts after 1 May 1993\n\nOn 30 September 1993 the proceedings were stayed.\n\nOn 15 January 1994 the applicant's mother died. On 10 January 1995 the applicant confirmed that she wished to continue the proceedings in her stead and requested that the proceedings be resumed.\n\nOn 22 October 1996 the court refused to resume the proceedings, stating that the applicant had failed to comply with the court's order to produce the inheritance decisions concerning the defendants.\n\nThe applicant lodged numerous requests for the resumption of the proceedings, to no avail. She submitted that the courts had refused to serve on her the requested decisions, since she was not the defendants' relative.\n\nOn 20 September 2004 the proceedings were eventually resumed on the applicant's request.\n\nOn 16 November 2004 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 13 April 2005 the court stayed the proceedings. The applicant did not lodge an appeal against this decision.\n\nThe applicant lodged two motions for the resumption of the proceedings. They were dismissed by the court on 23 October and 15 December 2006. The applicant lodged an appeal against the second decision.\n\nOn 23 October 2007 the Warsaw Court of Appeal amended the decision of 15 December 2006 and resumed the proceedings. The court held that the decision of 13 April 2005 was ill-founded since there were no legal grounds for staying the proceedings.\n\nOn 22 October 2008 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 23 October 2008 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment dismissing the applicant's plea as unfounded. On 3 December 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal. It appears that the proceedings are still pending.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 30 July 2007 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw Court of Appeal a complaint under section 5 of the Law on 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d) which entered into force on 17 September 2004. She sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the Warsaw Regional Court had been excessive. She asked for the acceleration of the proceedings and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approx. 2,500 euros (EUR)).\n\nOn 6 September 2007 the Warszawa Court of Appeal dismissed the complaint. The court held that on 17 September 2004, the date on which the 2004 Act had entered into force, the proceedings in the case had been stayed. Therefore, in the court's opinion, there was no undue delay on the part of the trial court. The court further found that after the resumption of the proceedings on 20 September 2004 there had been no inactivity for which the Regional Court could be held responsible."}

in an application (no. 62590/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Yasin B\u00f6ber (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 6 November 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Y. Ba\u015fara Filorinal\u0131 and Mr M. Filorinal\u0131, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 23 June 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 28 June 2003 two police officers went to the Be\u015fikta\u015f district of Istanbul following a complaint by a woman, and imposed an administrative fine on a taxi driver. Subsequently, the policemen and the taxi driver commenced a verbal dispute in the presence of the applicant, who is also a taxi driver. The applicant told the police officers that he would pay the fine on his friend\u2019s behalf. The police officers then pushed the applicant to the ground, handcuffed him and began kicking and punching him. He was subsequently put in the police car. One of the police officers closed the car door on the applicant\u2019s leg.\n\nThe applicant was arrested and taken to the Be\u015fikta\u015f police station by the officers, as he was accused of having insulted them.\n\nThe applicant was then taken to the Taksim Hospital. According to a medical report issued following X-rays and an orthopaedic examination of the applicant, his right leg was broken as a result of the incident.\n\nOn 29 June 2003 the applicant was examined by a forensic expert at the Istanbul branch of the Forensic Medicine Institute. The doctor observed a bruise of 4 cm on the left scapula, two bruises of 3 cm and 1 cm on the front of the right shoulder, two grazes of 1.5 x 1 cm on both elbows, several grazes on the upper part of the right arm within an area measuring 5 x 4 cm, and five bruises of 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter on the right arm. The doctor also observed that the applicant\u2019s right leg was in plaster up to his knee.\n\nThe final report of the Forensic Medicine Institute dated 1 July 2003 confirmed that the applicant\u2019s leg was broken and stated that the injuries rendered him unfit for fifteen days.\n\nOn an unspecified date a criminal case was brought before the 12th Chamber of the Istanbul Criminal Court against the applicant for insulting the police officers. Subsequently, on 20 October 2003 the applicant lodged a petition with the trial court and requested that the police officers be punished for ill-treating him.\n\nOn 31 January 2005 the 12th Chamber of the Istanbul Criminal Court acquitted the applicant of the charges against him in respect of one of the officers. As regards the second officer, who had closed the car door on the applicant\u2019s leg, the court found that the applicant had insulted him. However, since the officer had overstepped his authority by his actions, the court decided not to convict the applicant.\n\nMeanwhile, on 4 May 2004 the Istanbul public prosecutor filed an indictment with the 1st Chamber of the Istanbul Criminal Court against the police officers, charging them with ill-treatment of the applicant. The applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party.\n\nOn 23 December 2008 the 1st Chamber of the Istanbul Criminal Court convicted the police officers as charged. The court found, in the light of the medical reports that it had obtained, plus the witness statements and the submissions of the accused and the applicant, that the police officers had beaten the applicant and had closed the car door on his leg and had thus caused the injuries found on the applicant\u2019s body on 28 and 29 June 2003. The court sentenced the accused police officers to two months and fifteen days\u2019 imprisonment. Having regard to the fact that the police officers did not have criminal records and to the manner in which they had committed the offence in question, the first-instance court considered that the police officers would not commit any further offence. It therefore decided to suspend the pronouncement of the judgment (h\u00fckm\u00fcn a\u00e7\u0131klanmas\u0131n\u0131n geri b\u0131rak\u0131lmas\u0131) for a period of five years, pursuant to Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 5271).\n\nOn 29 December 2008 the applicant lodged an objection to the judgment of the first-instance court. In his petition, the applicant noted that he would make more detailed submissions after he had been provided with a copy of the reasons for judgment, and requested that a hearing be held.\n\nOn 21 April 2009 the Istanbul Assize Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s objection of 29 December 2008 after obtaining the Istanbul public prosecutor\u2019s opinion, without awaiting the applicant\u2019s further submissions and without holding a hearing. As domestic legislation did not provide for an appeal, this decision was final.\n\nOn 8 May 2009 the decision of the Istanbul Assize Court was notified to the applicant."}

three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 24271/94) against the French Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under Article 25 by a French national, Mr Guy Couez, on 8 July 1993. The Government\u2019s application referred to Article 48 of the Convention. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and sought leave to present his own case. The President of the Chamber refused leave and requested the applicant to appoint to represent him an advocate authorised to practise in any of the Contracting States and resident in the territory of one of them (Rule 30 \u00a7 1). As the applicant did not designate a representative within the time allowed him by the President, the Court assumed that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings.\n\nOn 25 September 1997 the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, decided, under Rule 21 \u00a7 7 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider both the instant case and the case of Benkessiouer v. France. The Chamber to be constituted for that purpose included ex officio Mr L.-E. Pettiti, the elected judge of French nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 4 (b)). On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc, Mr F. Matscher, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr N. Valticos, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr V. Butkevych (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 5). Subsequently Mr G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc replaced Mr Bernhardt as President of the Chamber and Mr E. Levits, substitute judge, became a full member of the Chamber, and Mr K. Jungwiert, substitute judge, replaced Mr Matscher, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 \u00a7 1 and 24 \u00a7 1).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, Mr Y. Charpentier, the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission, Mr J.-C. Soyer, on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 \u00a7 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant\u2019s claims under Article 50 of the Convention on 17 March 1998 and the Government\u2019s memorial on 1 April 1998. On 20 April 1998 the Delegate of the Commission stated that he did not wish to submit observations on those documents.\n\nOn 24 February 1998 the Chamber decided to dispense with a hearing in the case, having satisfied itself that the conditions for this derogation from its usual procedure had been met (Rules 26 and 38).\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. the CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nMr Couez was born in 1941 and lives at Saint-Quentin (d\u00e9partement of Aisne). On 20 January 1989 he had a heart attack during the annual cross-country race held by the company of CRS (Compagnies r\u00e9publicaines de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u2013 mobile security police units) to which he belonged. After being on sick-leave from 20 to 23 January 1989 and from 25 January to 11 April 1989, he returned to work. On 8 February 1991 he applied for extended sick-leave and asked that his heart attack and the subsequent periods of sick-leave should be recognised as work-related so that he would be covered by the rules applicable to police officers injured in the execution of their duty.\n\nOn 3 May 1991 the inter-d\u00e9partement medical board recommended that the application for extended sick-leave should be refused. On 14 May 1991 Mr Couez was notified of his authorities\u2019 refusal to grant him the leave. In a letter of 27 December 1991 the Prefect of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region informed the applicant that the medical board had recommended that his sick-leave should not be regarded as having been work-related and that he should be declared permanently unfit for active police duties and be transferred to the administrative staff until his retirement at 60; he stated that if either Mr Couez or the Ministry of the Interior refused this transfer, the applicant would be retired on grounds of invalidity with immediate effect.\n\nA. The proceedings to challenge the authorities\u2019 refusal to regard the sick-leave as having been due to a work-related accident\n\nOn 20 January 1992 the applicant brought proceedings in the Amiens Administrative Court to challenge the Prefect\u2019s decision of 27 December 1991 to inform him that the medical board had refused to regard sick-leave on 8 April 1990 as having been due to a work-related accident. On 5 February 1992 he also applied for a stay of execution of that decision. In the meantime, on 25 January 1992, Mr Couez had refused transfer to the administrative staff and on 3 February 1992 the Ministry of the Interior had declared him unfit for active police duties and had placed him on the ordinary sick list with retrospective effect from 8 August 1990.\n\nIn a judgment of 2 July 1992 the Amiens Administrative Court refused the application for a stay of execution of the decision of 27 December 1991. On 10 July 1992 Mr Couez was sent on compulsory unpaid leave of absence (disponibilit\u00e9) with effect from 8 August 1991, the date on which he had exhausted his entitlement to ordinary sick-leave. On 4 September 1992, in a fresh decision, he was maintained in the same position.\n\nOn 5 August 1992 the Prefect informed the applicant that a Dr B. had been designated to examine him with a view to his being retired on grounds of invalidity.\n\nOn 24 March 1993 Mr Couez applied to the Amiens Administrative Court for an interim ruling by its President in the proceedings he had brought on 20 January 1992 (see paragraph 8 above). In an order of 25 March 1993 the President of the Administrative Court refused the application.\n\nOn 24 January 1994 Mr Couez was retired on grounds of invalidity.\n\nOn 31 May 1995 the Administrative Court made an interlocutory order for a medical report on the applicant. On 28 June 1996 it quashed the decisions of 10 July and 4 September 1992 in so far as they kept Mr Couez on compulsory unpaid leave of absence from 15 January 1992; it also set aside the decision of 24 January 1994 whereby he had been retired on grounds of invalidity (see paragraph 12 above); the court held that the applicant should have been retired on 25 January 1992, when he had refused the transfer proposal that had been made to him (see paragraph 8 above). On 25 July 1995 Mr Couez had appealed against the interlocutory order of 31 May 1995, and that appeal was still pending in the Nancy Administrative Court of Appeal on the date of delivery of the present judgment.\n\nAccording to the Government, the applicant submitted twenty-seven pleadings between 20 January 1992 (the date of the application to the Amiens Administrative Court) and 28 June 1996 (when that court gave judgment).\n\nB. The proceedings to challenge the decision requiring unpaid leave of absence to be taken\n\nOn 18 March 1992 Mr Couez had also brought proceedings in the Amiens Administrative Court to challenge the decision of 10 July 1992 whereby he had been sent on compulsory unpaid leave of absence (see paragraph 9 above). He subsequently withdrew these proceedings, and on 31 May 1995 the Administrative Court delivered a judgment formally taking notice of the withdrawal. On 31 July 1995 the applicant appealed against that judgment, and the appeal was still pending in the Nancy Administrative Court of Appeal on the date of delivery of the present judgment.\n\nAccording to the Government, the applicant filed seven pleadings with the Amiens Administrative Court (between 18 March 1992 and 31 May 1995) and three in the Nancy Administrative Court of Appeal (between 31 July 1995 and 4 June 1996)."}

"Zamo\u015b\u0107", "Regional", "Court", "."], "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 73003/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mrs Genowefa Grela (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 22 June 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki and subsequently, Mrs S. Jaczewska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 30 April 2002 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Zamo\u015b\u0107, Poland.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s father and mother died in 1982 and 1983 respectively. On 2 March 1984 the Zamo\u015b\u0107 District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) declared that the applicant and her three brothers were to inherit their estate. On 17 September 1985 the applicant filed an application for distribution of the estate with the Zamo\u015b\u0107 District Court. From 30 October 1985 to 27 June 1991 the court held thirty six hearings. It also obtained five expert reports.\n\nOn 28 September 1993 the court held a hearing during which it heard evidence from the applicant and one of her brothers. The court held a further hearing on 25 October 1993.\n\nOn 8 November 1993 the court closed the examination of the case and informed the parties that a preliminary decision would be delivered on 22 November 1993. It later resumed the examination of the case and listed a hearing for 24 January 1994. At that hearing, the court again heard evidence from the applicant and one of her brothers.\n\nIn April 1994 the applicant personally went to the court\u2019s registry and asked the President of the Zamo\u015b\u0107 District Court to fix a date for a hearing as soon as possible; she also complained about the slow progress in the proceedings.\n\nOn 16 May 1994 the court held a hearing, heard five witnesses and ordered an expert to prepare a report. On 20 June 1994 the expert submitted his report to the court. On 12 December 1994 and 16 January 1995 the court held further hearings.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings several judge rapporteurs dealt with the case.\n\nIn February 1995 the applicant sent a letter to the Minister of Justice asking that the proceedings be expedited. In a letter of 30 March 1995 the President of the Zamo\u015b\u0107 Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) informed the applicant that he would personally supervise the conduct of the proceedings. He also admitted that the proceedings had been slowed down as a result of changes of rapporteurs.\n\nOn 22 January 1996 the court obtained an expert report. On 17 April 1996 the court held a hearing. Two further expert reports were submitted to the court on 25 May 1995 and 16 June 1996, respectively.\n\nThe court held hearings on 26 January and 9, 16 and 23 February 1999. On 20 April, 12 May and 24 October 1999, respectively, the experts submitted supplementary reports.\n\nOn 4 February, 3 March and 17 March 2000 the court held hearings and heard evidence from several witnesses. On 4 April 2000 the court informed the parties that the final decision would be delivered on 18 April 2000.\n\nOn 18 April 2000 the court decided that it would not deliver the final decision and resumed the proceedings. On the same date the court asked the applicant to submit an extract from the land register confirming that her late parents had owned a certain plot of land. On 4 May 2000 the applicant made submissions to the court. She maintained that she was not able to produce the documents required by the court because her parents did not have title to that property.\n\nOn 15 May 2000 the court stayed the proceedings. It held that the applicant had failed to comply with the order of 18 April 2000. Subsequently, on 20 September 2001 the applicant asked the court to resume the proceedings. On 23 January 2002 the Zamo\u015b\u0107 Regional Court resumed the proceedings.\n\nOn 1 March 2002 the District Court held a hearing. On 15 March 2002 it gave a final decision. The applicant appealed. On 13 November and 4 December 2002 the Regional Court held hearings. On 14 December 2002 the Zamo\u015b\u0107 Regional Court upheld the first-instance decision. It appears that this decision is final."}

against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mrs Helena Sawicka (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 10 March 1997.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Krzysztof Drzewicki of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the civil proceedings in her case exceeded a reasonable time, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. .\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy a decision of 11 October 2001 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a Polish national, born in 1930 and living in Warsaw.\n\nOn 2 November 1987 the applicant lodged a motion with the Warsaw District Court, claiming division of conjugal property, consisting, as she claimed, of 42 pieces of movable property. Subsequently, hearings were held on, inter alia, 18 May 1988, 11 January 1989 and 17 February 1989.\n\nIn 1990 an expert submitted a report concerning the value of movable property. Apparently, on an unspecified later date, the President of the District Court, following the applicant\u2019s complaints about the lack of progress in the case, ordered that the conduct of the proceedings be supervised by him. On an unspecified date in 1991 the case was transferred to another judge rapporteur. On 1 April 1992 the applicant again complained about the excessive length of the proceedings.\n\nOn an unspecified date the defendant claimed that a house in which the applicant lived should be included in the property concerned. On an unspecified date four years after the beginning of the proceedings he submitted certain documents to prove that his family had borne certain costs relating to the construction of the house. On 15 January 1992 a hearing was held and the court ordered that an expert report be prepared to estimate the value of the house. On 9 February 1993 the defendant proposed that a court settlement be concluded. The applicant did not accept the proposed terms. On the whole, 22 hearings were held until 1 May 1993, the date on which Poland\u2019s recognition of the right of individual petition became effective.\n\nIn 1993 further hearings were held on 17 August, 16 September, 2 November and 2 December. Later on, the court again appointed an expert with the task of producing an estimate of the value of movable property. The defendant twice failed to make his property accessible to the expert.\n\nIn reply to the applicant\u2019s fresh complaint about the excessive length of the proceedings, on 2 July 1994 the President of the Warsaw Regional Court informed her that the case was complex as the property concerned consisted of a substantial number of objects. Moreover, the parties submitted conflicting claims as to whether a certain plot of land constituted a part of this property, and concerning expenditure borne by them. What was more, the parties had repeatedly submitted new requests for evidence to be taken, which the court had allowed. As a result, further hearings had been held on 2 November and 2 December 1993, 11 July and 27 September 1994. Two further expert opinions had been prepared in order to complete the previously submitted opinions, as the lapse of time had rendered the old ones obsolete.\n\nOn 2 November 1994 the applicant submitted her further pleadings. On 4 November 1994 a hearing was held. As witness R.S. failed to attend, the court imposed a fine on her and adjourned the hearing for 18 November 1994. On that day, the court lifted the fine as R.S. had informed the court that she was of advanced age and could therefore not come to the court.\n\nOn 8 February 1995 the court ordered that enforcement proceedings be instituted against the applicant as she had failed to pay her part of the expert\u2019s fees, despite two summonses to do so.\n\nOn 14 March 1995 the court ordered that a new expert, M.S., draw up a further opinion as to the value of movables in order to complement the opinions that had been prepared previously. On 22 March 1995 the defendant submitted his new pleadings.\n\nOn 23 March 1995 the applicant again complained about the length of the proceedings. On 19 April 1995 the Deputy President of the Regional Court informed her in reply that the proceedings had indeed lasted for a long time, but there was nothing to suggest that they were not conducted diligently. The new judge rapporteur, who had been appointed in the meantime, had been taking appropriate measures in order to proceed further.\n\nOn 17 May 1995 the applicant complained again about the excessive length of the proceedings. Further hearings were held on 22 June and 19 September 1995. On 21 September 1995 the defendant requested that the expert opinion of the expert in construction issues be complemented by indicating the value of certain building materials used for the construction of the house constituting a part of the conjugal property.\n\nOn 11 April 1996 the applicant complained once more about the length of the proceedings. In his reply of 23 April 1996, the President of the Regional Court informed her that he had no influence whatsoever in so far as changes of judge rapporteurs caused by their leaving the judiciary were concerned. Judge G., who had been the previous rapporteur, had left the judiciary and indeed, for a certain period his cases had not been assigned to another judge. However, a new rapporteur had been appointed and the next hearing was to be held on 11 June 1996.\n\nIn a letter to the President of the Regional Court of 9 May 1996, the Polish Helsinki Committee drew his attention to the fact that the case had remained pending since 1987, which seemed to be in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and that the judge rapporteur had been changed four times. As a result, each time the hearings in the case had to be recommenced.\n\nOn 28 June 1996 the applicant further requested the court to speed up the proceedings, submitting that she was in a very difficult financial position and that the outcome of the case, if the court found in her favour, could positively affect her situation.\n\nApparently on 4 October 1996 the applicant again complained about the length of the proceedings. In his reply of 8 November 1996, the President of the Regional Court stated that her complaints were well founded, that the attention of the judge rapporteur had been drawn thereto, and that the case-file would be sent to experts with no delay in order for further questions to be answered.\n\nOn 20 November 1996 the applicant drew the court\u2019s attention to the fact that five months had elapsed since the last hearing.\n\nOn 27 January 1997 the Regional Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal against a decision of 13 December 1996, concerning the expert\u2019s fee. On 5 February 1997 the court in part amended its decision of 6 November 1996 concerning a further expert opinion and changed questions to be put to the expert in construction issues.\n\nOn an unspecified later date the Ombudsman requested the Regional Court to explain grounds of a certain further period of inactivity in the case. In a reply of 11 July 1997, the Ombudsman\u2019s office was informed that the judge rapporteur had been on sick leave since April 1997. The applicant\u2019s case, in view of its considerable length to date, would exceptionally be assigned to another judge. The case-file would immediately be sent to one of the three experts called to submit their complementary opinions.\n\nOn 4 October 1997 the defendant submitted his pleadings, calling into question the contents and conclusion of the expert opinion prepared by M.S., which had meanwhile been submitted to the court. On 29 October 1997 he submitted further pleadings. On 12 November 1997 a hearing was held. The Regional Court served on the defendant the applicant\u2019s pleadings of 7, 9, 13, 28 and 29 October 1997. The court adjourned the hearing sine die, and ordered the parties to submit a list of movables constituting the property. Expert M.S. refused to prepare a further report, indicating that the parties had not co-operated with him properly.\n\nIn a letter of 30 June 1998, in reply to the applicant\u2019s complaint about the length of the proceedings of 24 April 1998, the Ministry of Justice informed her that the length of the proceedings had in part been caused by the attitude of the parties, who repeatedly referred in their pleadings to facts and decisions given in other sets of proceedings, submitted numerous and voluminous pleadings, often having no relation whatsoever to the subject of the proceedings. The case-file counted seven volumes, consisting in a large part of these pleadings.\n\nAt a hearing held on 15 June 1998 the court attempted to make the parties conclude a court settlement. They were further ordered to state their positions in a precise manner and the time-limit for doing so was set for 18 August 1998.\n\nIn reply of 19 October 1998 to the applicant\u2019s new complaint, the President of the Court of Appeal stated that the fact that the case had not been in part dealt with sufficient speed, was a ground on which it had been taken into the administrative supervision by the President of the District Court. The changes of presiding judges had been caused by reasons which could not be attributed to the court.\n\nA further hearing was held on 16 October 1998 and a number of witnesses were interviewed. On 17 and 28 October 1998 the defendant submitted his further pleadings.\n\nOn 8 January 1999 another hearing was held. The court heard five witnesses. Further pleadings of the defendant were submitted on 15 January 1999. The next hearing was held on 13 April 1999.\n\nThe hearing scheduled for 23 December 1999 was adjourned as the judge was ill. Subsequent hearings were held on 21 April, 5 July and 25 September 2000.\n\nBy a letter of 24 August 2000 the President of the Civil Division of the Warsaw-Centre District Court informed the applicant that her complaints about the lack of progress in the proceedings were ill-founded. The length of proceedings had mostly been caused by measures taken by the parties themselves, the applicant included, in particular by their repeated requests that new evidence be taken and by their submitting voluminous pleadings.\n\nOn 26 October 2000 the applicant submitted her pleadings to the court, numbering 21 pages. These were subsequently served on the defendant and he was ordered to take a stand thereon within 21 days.\n\nOn 1 December 2000 the court ordered an expert opinion as to the value of the property in question. On 18 April 2001 this opinion was submitted to the court.\n\nThe proceedings are pending."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) on 9 July 1997 within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 22954/93) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by Mr Mobin Ahmed, Mr Dennis Perrin, Mr Ray Bentley and Mr David John Brough, all British citizens, on 21 September 1993. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent them (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 4 (b)). On 27 August 1997, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Macdonald, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr D. Gotchev, Mr P. K\u016bris and Mr P. van Dijk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 5). Subsequently, Mr L.-E. Pettiti and Mr R. Pekkanen replaced Mr Macdonald and Mr Russo who were unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 22 \u00a7 1).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d), the applicants\u2019 lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 \u00a7 1 and 38). Pursuant to the orders made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicants\u2019 memorial on 22 December 1997 and the Government\u2019s memorial on 15 January 1998. A schedule to the applicants\u2019 memorial setting out details of their claims under Article 50 of the Convention was received at the registry on 22 January 1998. An amended schedule of claims was filed with the registry on 27 April 1998. The Government\u2019s responses to the applicants\u2019 claims were filed with the registry on 21 April and 18 May 1998. The applicants filed observations in reply on 29 May 1998.\n\nOn 2 September 1997 the President of the Chamber granted Liberty, a non-governmental organisation based in London, leave to submit written comments on the case (Rule 37 \u00a7 2). These were received on 12 January 1998 and subsequently communicated to the Agent of the Government, the representative of the applicants and the Delegate of the Commission for possible observations. No observations were submitted.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 22 April 1998. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr C. Whomersley, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr J. Morris QC, Attorney-General, Mr J. Eadie, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr I. MacLeod, Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, Mr P. Rowsell, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Mr D. Steele, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Advisers; (b) for the Commission Mr N. Bratza, Delegate; (c) for the applicants Mr J. Goudie QC, Mr A. Lynch, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr B. Banks, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza, Mr Goudie and Mr Morris.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. The applicants\n\nMr Mobin Ahmed, Mr Dennis Perrin, Mr Ray Bentley and Mr David Brough are all British citizens, born in 1941, 1948, 1947 and 1932 respectively. They live in London, Yelverton, Edgware and Exeter respectively. At the relevant time they were each permanently employed in different capacities by various local authorities. Their precise status and functions are described in Section C below. The background to their complaints to the Convention institutions is constituted by the enactment and implementation of legislative measures designed to limit the involvement of certain categories of local government officials, such as themselves, in political activities. The history of the enactment of the relevant measures as well as their purport and scope are described in Section B below. The impact of the measures on the applicants, all persons considered holders of politically restricted posts within the meaning of the applicable legislation, is described in Section C below.\n\nB. The adoption of the Local Government Officers (Political Restrictions) Regulations 1990\n\n1. The political background to the adoption of the Regulations\n\nAgainst the background of the increasing politicisation of local government and attendant problems in respect of the relationship between elected members and local government officers, the Secretaries of State for the Environment, for Scotland and for Wales, appointed on 5 February 1985 a committee (\u201cthe Widdicombe Committee\u201d) to inquire, inter alia, into the respective roles of elected members and officers of local government authorities and to make any necessary recommendations for strengthening the democratic process.\n\nOn 9 May 1986, after receiving evidence from 138 local government authorities and over 500 other organisations and individuals, the Widdicombe Committee submitted its report. The Committee firmly endorsed the continuation of the tradition of politically impartial local government officers having regard in particular to the roles of senior officers as managers, advisers and arbitrators in the day-to-day functioning of local government. In his foreword to the final report the Chairman of the Committee wrote: \u201c6. Although most of the problems we have perceived have been ones of uncertain relations, there have been some cases, albeit a few, where power has been abused.\u201d In the Chairman\u2019s view, the recent sharpening of the political intensity of local politics was reflected in the relations between elected council members and local government officers and that the trend towards greater politicisation might be a source of future problems unless recommendations were made in order to provide a framework able to cope with it. With regard to the importance of the impartiality of local government officers, the Widdicombe Committee concluded that: \u201c6.141. The overwhelming view in the evidence we have received has been that officers (subject to very limited and closely defined exceptions) should continue to serve the council as a whole. \u2026 There has been equally wide agreement that the public service tradition of a permanent corps of politically impartial officers should be retained. \u2026 6.180. Public service in the United Kingdom is founded on a tradition of a permanent corps of politically neutral officers serving with equal commitment whatever party may be in political control. \u2026 6.182. Local government in the United Kingdom has traditionally been based on the same public service tradition as central government, but this has been a matter of convention and practice. \u2026 6.186. The issue of principle is therefore straightforward. There must continue to be a system of permanent and politically neutral officers appointed on the basis of merit. The issue which we need to consider is whether new machinery or rules are required to ensure this, and if so on what basis.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that senior officers continued to discharge their functions in a manner which was impartial from both a subjective and an objective point of view, the Widdicombe Committee in paragraph 6.217 of its report recommended that: \u201c(a) the legislation should be amended so that persons who are councillors or who are standing for election as councillors, or who have been councillors within the last year, may not be employed by another authority at the rank of principal officer or above; (b) the Local Authorities\u2019 Conditions of Service Advisory Board should take steps to include in the terms and conditions of officers at the rank of principal officer and above a prohibition on political activity, including: (i) standing for, and holding, public elected office; (ii) holding office in a political party; (iii) speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate; and (iv) canvassing at elections; (c) if the changes recommended at (b) are not made to officers\u2019 terms and conditions, legislation should be introduced to similar effect.\u201d\n\n2. The adoption of the Regulations\n\nFollowing the publication of the recommendations of the Widdicombe Committee, on 16 November 1989 the House of Commons passed the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), which empowered the Secretary of State for the Environment to make regulations to restrict the political activities of certain categories of local government officers. The Act entered into force on 29 November 1989.\n\nThe Local Government Officers (Political Restrictions) Regulations 1990 (\u201cthe Regulations\u201d) were made under section 1(5) of the Act on 4 April 1990. They were laid before Parliament the following day and came into force on 1 May 1990. The Regulations applied to all persons holding a politically restricted post as defined in section 2(1) of the Act. This term covers three broad categories of local government officials: the most senior post-holders in local government (category one); officials remunerated in excess of a prescribed level and whose posts are listed for the purposes of the application of the Regulations (category two); and officials paid less than the prescribed level but who hold a listed post (category three). Each local authority was obliged to draw up a list of posts falling within the second and third categories (section 2(2)). A local government officer in the second and third categories could apply to an independent adjudicator to have his or her post removed from the list of posts to which the Regulations applied (section 3). All local government officials employed in these categories at the time of the entry into force of the Regulations were deemed, according to regulation 3(1), to be subject to the measures. A more detailed analysis of the contents of the Act and the Regulations is set out at paragraphs 26\u201333 below.\n\nC. The effect of the Regulations on the applicants\n\n1. Mr Ahmed\n\nThe first applicant, Mr Ahmed, was a solicitor employed by the London Borough of Hackney. Although his salary fell below the level prescribed in section 2(2)(a) of the Act (see paragraphs 12 above and especially 30 below), making him a category three officer, the Council pursuant to section 2(2)(c) of the Act included his post in the list of politically restricted posts because, in its opinion, his post involved giving advice on a regular basis to committees of the Council, namely the Housing Benefits Review Board, the Housing Development Sub-Committee and the Environmental Sub-Committee (see paragraph 30 below).\n\nMr Ahmed was adopted as Labour candidate for election to the London Borough of Enfield in 1990, but was obliged to withdraw his candidature as a result of the Regulations. On 7 March 1990 he applied for removal of his job description from the list of politically restricted posts (see paragraphs 12 above and especially 32 below). The Council confirmed that Mr Ahmed had not attended committees during the previous twelve months, but stated that he would be involved in giving advice to committees in future, and would attend on a more regular basis. The Council did not provide therefore a certificate stating that he did not give advice regularly. The adjudicator replied to the Council on 30 March 1990 that Mr Ahmed\u2019s application for exemption could not therefore be granted.\n\n2. Mr Perrin\n\nPrior to his retirement, the second applicant, Mr Perrin, was Principal Valuer with the Devon County Council (a category three officer). He was responsible for leading, directing and developing the Council\u2019s area valuation staff. His post required him to give regular advice to the Council\u2019s committees, including strategy advice on key estate management issues, and to speak to the media. Accordingly his post was included in the list of politically restricted posts kept by the Council in accordance with section 2(2) of the Act (see paragraph 12 above and especially paragraph 31 below).\n\nOn 19 February 1990 Mr Perrin applied for exemption from political restrictions on the ground that although he advised the Council at meetings and spoke to the media, the advice was \u201cfactual valuation information regarding the acquisition, disposal and management of property\u201d. His application for exemption was refused on 20 March 1990. The adjudicator wrote: \u201cI am satisfied that the duties of your post do fall within section 2(3) of the Act in that you do regularly attend committee meetings of the authority to give advice. Your authority do state that this advice does not extend to \u2018policy advice\u2019, but the Act itself makes no distinction between types of advice. I am not prepared, therefore, to grant an exemption under section 3(4) of the Act.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the Regulations, Mr Perrin had to give up his position as Vice-Chair and Property Officer of the Exeter Constituency Labour Party, and had to refrain from supporting and assisting Labour candidates in Exeter City Council elections, including his wife, who was a candidate in May 1990 and May 1991. He also reduced his involvement in trade union activities.\n\n3. Mr Bentley\n\nThe third applicant, Mr Bentley, is a planning manager with Plymouth City Council. He resigned from his position as Chairman of Torridge and West Devon Constituency Labour Party because of the Regulations, and was also restricted in canvassing for his wife who stood as the only Labour Councillor for the West Devon Borough Council, and in giving radio interviews in his capacity as Chairman of the Plymouth Health Emergency, a body concerned with National Health policies.\n\nThe monitoring officer of the Council classified Mr Bentley\u2019s post as one that was politically sensitive (a category one post) and appropriately subject to political restrictions under section 2(3) of the Act (see paragraph 30 below). The reasons for the classification included that Mr Bentley was head of the Council\u2019s corporate policy unit, that he was responsible directly to the head of the Council\u2019s paid service, that his post was responsible for policy analysis and research, that he represented the Council on a transport steering group involving other authorities and organisations, and that, in the twelve months prior to 31 August 1990, he attended three meetings of the Council\u2019s Policy and Resources (Finance sub-) Committee and advised on four separate issues of public transport. The monitoring officer considered that Mr Bentley\u2019s post also fell within section 2(7)(a) and (b) of the Act, and was therefore politically restricted in any event (see paragraph 28 below).\n\nMr Bentley applied for exemption from political restrictions. On 19 November 1990 the adjudicator underlined that he regarded his duties as limited to considering applications concerning restrictions under section 2(2) of the Act. He stated that although the Council may have identified the post as being politically restricted, it was not \u201cpolitically restricted because of that fact, but because it is explicitly covered by section 2(1)(c) of the Act. I therefore do not consider it necessary or desirable to address the question of whether this post meets the criteria for inclusion in the list of posts under section 2(2) or for exemption from that list, unless or until it is established that the post is not covered by section 2(1)(c).\u201d\n\n4. Mr Brough\n\nThe fourth applicant, Mr Brough, is employed by the Hillingdon Borough Council as the head of its Committee Services Department (a category one post). The provision of services to the Council\u2019s committees necessarily involves the Committee Services Department in frequent contact with and giving advice to the elected members of the Council. Mr Brough was the officer responsible for those activities.\n\nAs a consequence of the Regulations, Mr Brough can no longer act as Parliamentary Chairman of his party in Harrow East and is prevented from speaking at public meetings on issues such as housing and the health service. Mr Brough did not apply for exemption from the scope of the Regulations.\n\nD. Judicial review proceedings challenging the validity of the Regulations\n\nThe applicants and NALGO (the predecessor of UNISON, the trade union of which the applicants are members and which represents public-sector workers) applied for and were granted leave to apply for judicial review of the Regulations. The application was dismissed on 20 December 1991. The judge, Mr Justice Hutchison, considered that he was bound by the recent decision of the House of Lords in the case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind and Others regarding the status of Article 10 of the Convention in domestic law. In connection with the test of \u201cWednesbury\u201d unreasonableness, the judge referred to an affidavit submitted by Mr Simcock, a senior civil servant at the Department of the Environment, in which Mr Simcock explained how the Widdicombe Committee (see paragraph 8 above) had been set up in 1985 to inquire into local authority practices and procedures with particular reference to the respective roles of elected members and officers. Mr Simcock also described the consultation process between the publication of the Widdicombe Report and the making of the Regulations, in which NALGO was involved, and how the Regulations were in some respects less restrictive than the Widdicombe Committee\u2019s proposals. Referring to senior officers, the Widdicombe Committee had said: \u201c... It is part of their job to advise councillors, and to adjudicate on matters of propriety, and in so doing they must command the respect and trust of all political parties. There might well be some senior officers who are politically active but who are nevertheless totally able to detach themselves from such activity in carrying out their duties as neutral officers. Nevertheless we believe there will always be a very significant risk that they are viewed with suspicion by councillors of other parties, and that as a consequence the performance of their duties towards the council as a whole will be impaired.\u201d The judge continued: \u201c... I preface my summary by pointing out that some of [the applicants\u2019 complaints] reflect the applicants\u2019 root and branch opposition to the whole concept of restricting the political activities of local government employees. It is said that:\n\n(a) There was no pressing social need for the Regulations \u2013 local government employees have in the past provided impartial advice and there is public confidence in their ability to do so.\n\n(b) The definition of [persons holding politically restricted posts] is unduly wide \u2013 a much more restricted category would have served the government\u2019s purpose.\n\n(c) The restrictions are expressed in broad, subjective and uncertain terms \u2013 a vice particularly objectionable where, as here, they seek to restrict fundamental human rights. Thus, in the Schedule references to apparent intention (paragraphs 6 and 7) and to publication in circumstances likely to create an impression (paragraphs 9 and 10) are objectionable, as is paragraph 4 of the Regulations themselves.\n\n(d) The consequence of the vice mentioned in the previous paragraph is that employees are likely to be treated inconsistently by different employers, by reason of there being room for undue latitude in interpreting the restrictions.\n\n(e) The Regulations go too far in prohibiting conduct undertaken with apparent intention, etc., or likely to create the impression of support, etc. They should, at most, have proscribed actual political activities.\n\n(f) The width of the language used means that many non-party political activities, including trade unions and charitable activities, are prohibited.\n\n(g) The terms are imposed on existing employees, who entered into their contracts of employment on a different basis.\n\n(h) The restrictions may have an adverse effect on recruitment and lead to resignations by skilled staff.\n\nSome of these points will have to be considered individually when I come to deal with further arguments advanced by the applicants under quite different heads, but in the context of Wednesbury unreasonableness I propose only to say that they do not in my judgment come near to establishing a case of perversity. I have already briefly referred to the genesis of the Act and the Regulations in the Widdicombe Report, and to the consultative processes that followed it. Paragraph 51 of the Report contained the recommendation that: \u2018... terms and conditions of [persons holding politically restricted posts] [should include] a prohibition on political activity, including ... (iii) speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate;\u2019 The Government\u2019s Command Paper in July 1988 (in which, as already mentioned, the view was expressed that the categories of [persons holding politically restricted posts] should be more restricted than the Report proposed) spelt out the essential aim that: \u2018it was important that the post-holder should be seen to be politically impartial but that otherwise, local government employees should not be subject to restrictions on their political activity.\u2019 Of the specific arguments mentioned in (a) to (h) above, those in (a), (b), (e), (g) and (h) are, it seems to me, essentially arguments against the whole concept of restricting such activities, and in the circumstances cannot found an attack on Wednesbury grounds. The arguments summarised in (c) and (d) are to the effect that the Regulations are uncertain and incapable of consistent and fair application. As a Wednesbury argument, this contention could not avail the applicants \u2013 at least unless the Regulations were void for uncertainty (this would be a distinct ground for challenge) which plainly they are not. Finally, the argument mentioned in (f) is in my view misconceived: the Regulations do not prohibit the kind of activities there mentioned. I shall have more to say on this subject when I deal with the applicants\u2019 specific arguments on vires and legitimate expectation, to the first of which I now turn.\u201d In conclusion, the judge found that the Regulations did not go beyond the policy and purpose of the Act, and rejected an argument that the applicants had a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d that the Government would not interfere with trade union activities on the basis of an assurance from the then minister for local government matters. 24. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on 26 November 1992. Lord Justice Neill found that the provisions of Article 10 of the Convention did not assist NALGO and the applicants, confirmed that it was not open to the courts below the House of Lords to depart from the traditional Wednesbury grounds in reviewing the decision of a minister who has exercised a discretion vested in him by Parliament, and found that the Regulations were not \u201cWednesbury unreasonable\u201d or ultra vires. He also agreed with the first-instance judge as to legitimate expectation. The other judges, Lords Justices Russell and Rose, agreed. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused. 25. The House of Lords refused leave to appeal to it on 24 March 1993."}

for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr J\u00f3zef Tabor (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 11 January 2001.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Zbigniew Cicho\u0144, a lawyer practising in Krak\u00f3w. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agents, Mr Krzysztof Drzewicki and, subsequently, by Mr Jakub Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the court\u2019s refusal to grant him legal assistance in connection with the preparation of a cassation appeal to the Supreme Court infringed his right to a fair hearing.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nBy a decision of 24 January 2006 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nIn July 1993 the applicant was employed at the refinery \u201cT.\u201d as director of a department. From 1993 to 1997 the conditions of his contract of employment were changed several times. On 30 September 1997 the refinery gave notice to terminate the applicant\u2019s contract.\n\nOn 7 October 1997 the applicant lodged with the Katowice Regional Court a compensation claim against the refinery, in the amount of PLN 19,273, for unlawful termination of his contract. He also claimed reinstatement. By a decision of 3 December of 1997 the Katowice Regional Court considered that it was not competent to examine his case and transmitted it to the Katowice District Labour Court.\n\nBy a judgment of 4 December 1998 the Katowice District Labour Court ordered the refinery to pay the applicant compensation of PLN 5,008.74 for unlawful termination of the employment contract. The compensation corresponded to 3 months\u2019 remuneration. The court dismissed the remaining claims.\n\nBoth parties to the proceedings appealed against the first-instance judgment. By a judgment of 18 November 1999 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed their appeals.\n\nOn 26 November 1999 the applicant requested the Katowice Regional Court to grant legal aid for the purpose of instituting cassation proceedings. He referred to his difficult financial situation and to the fact that he had been unemployed from November 1997 to May 1999 due to the termination of his employment contract by the defendant company. He also submitted that from May 1999 he had been receiving a net salary of PLN 750 and submitted documents to show the period of his unemployment and his earnings. In December 1999 the applicant, having received no response from the Katowice Regional Court, lodged a cassation appeal himself.\n\nBy a decision of 17 January 2000 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed his request for legal aid for the purpose of instituting the cassation proceedings without giving written reasons for its decision.\n\nOn the same day, the Katowice Regional Court rejected the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal on the ground that it had not been lodged by a lawyer, as required by the law.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal against these decisions with the Supreme Court. He also requested the grant of retrospective leave to lodge a cassation appeal out of time. He further asked that court to appoint a lawyer for him in order to assist him in the preparation of his appeal. The applicant argued that the Regional Court had failed to deal within the time-limit with his request for legal aid. This had forced the applicant to lodge the cassation appeal himself. The fact that the cassation appeal had been rejected, combined with the unmotivated refusal of legal aid, had made it impossible to have his interests protected and his arguments properly presented to the cassation court.\n\nBy a decision of 25 May 2000 the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against the decision rejecting the cassation appeal. The court observed that the applicable law clearly provided that a cassation appeal could only be lodged by a lawyer. The Supreme Court further refused to entertain the appeal in so far as it was related to the refusal of legal aid, observing that under the applicable legal provisions an appeal to the Supreme Court against an interlocutory decision of the Court of Appeal was only available against a decision to reject a cassation appeal."}

Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a public limited company incorporated under German law, Axel Springer AG (\u201cthe applicant company\u201d), on 19 August 2010.\n\nThe applicant company was represented by Mr U. B\u00f6rger, a lawyer practising in Hamburg. The German Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agents, Ms K. Behr and Mr H.-J. Behrens, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicant company alleged that an injunction prohibiting it from further publication of two sentences was in breach of Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nOn 28 March 2012 notice of the application was given to the Government.\n\nThe Media Legal Defence Initiative, a non-governmental organisation, was granted leave to submit written comments (Article 36 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant company is a public limited company with its registered office in Hamburg. Among other activities, it is the publisher of the mass-circulation daily newspaper Bild.\n\nA. Background to the case\n\nOn the evening of 22 May 2005, after his party (the Social Democratic Party (SPD)) had suffered a heavy election defeat in the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who had been in power as head of the Federal Government since 1998, announced that parliamentary elections would be brought forward to autumn 2005 from their scheduled date in September 2006. Because the early elections could not be held until the Bundestag (German Federal Parliament) had been dissolved \u2013 a process which could only take place by order of Federal President of Germany after a motion of confidence in the Federal Chancellor had been defeated \u2013 Chancellor Schr\u00f6der called a vote of confidence on 1 July 2005 and lost it, with 148 of the 304 members of parliament from the parties making up his government abstaining as requested by the Chancellor. On 21 July 2005 Federal President Horst K\u00f6hler dissolved the Bundestag. This means of securing the dissolution of Parliament prompted discussions in public and among members of parliament, and was also the subject of appeals to the Federal Constitutional Court, which, by a majority, dismissed them and ruled that the disputed procedure was in conformity with the Basic Law (see in particular the decision of 25 August 2005, nos. 2 BvE 4/05 and 7/05).\n\nThe elections were held on 18 September 2005. None of the main political parties emerged victorious with a sufficient majority, but the parties forming the outgoing Schr\u00f6der government (the SPD and the Greens) lost their majority. Subsequently, the conservative parties (the CDU and CSU) and the SPD agreed to form a coalition headed by Ms Angela Merkel, the candidate for the CDU and CSU. On 22 November 2005 Mr Schr\u00f6der left office and Ms Merkel was elected as the new Federal Chancellor.\n\nOn 9 December 2005, at a ceremony to mark the start of work on the Baltic Sea gas pipeline (\u201cOstseepipeline\u201d), it was announced that Mr Schr\u00f6der had been appointed chairman of the supervisory board of the German-Russian consortium NEGP (Konsortium Nordeurop\u00e4ische Gaspipeline). The aim of the consortium, which had its registered office in Switzerland and was controlled by the Russian company Gazprom, was to build a gas pipeline to supply Russian gas to western Europe. The agreement on the principle of building the pipeline had been signed on 11 April 2005 by the German company BASF and Gazprom in the presence of Mr Schr\u00f6der and the Russian President Vladimir Putin. The signing of the contract itself, initially scheduled for mid-October at an energy summit in Moscow, had taken place on 8 September 2005 \u2013 again in the presence of Mr Schr\u00f6der and Mr Putin \u2013 ten days before the early elections.\n\nOn the day of the announcement, a member of Bild\u2019s editorial staff attempted to contact the deputy spokesperson for the government, S. (who had continued to occupy this post under the new government), for information on the subject but received no reply. The following day he made a further attempt, which was likewise unsuccessful. Following a third request later that day, the deputy spokesperson informed the journalist that Mr Schr\u00f6der had nothing to add to his statement of 9 December 2005 in which he had indicated his willingness to accept an offer from the consortium partners to take up a position on its supervisory board.\n\nOn Sunday 11 December 2005 a Bild journalist called the vice-chairman of the parliamentary group of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), Carl-Ludwig Thiele.\n\nIn a sworn statement of 14 December 2005 the journalist affirmed that Mr Thiele had wondered whether Chancellor Schr\u00f6der had already spoken to the Russians about a lucrative position before calling the early elections in May 2005. When asked by the journalist what he meant, Mr Thiele had replied: \u201cThe early election gambit must now be seen in a new light\u201d. The journalist had then asked Mr Thiele whether he meant that Mr Schr\u00f6der might have triggered the fresh elections on the basis of promises from Russia. Mr Thiele had replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a question we need to ask\u201d. He had added that, from his own experience in politics, a matter involving such a major change in personal activity must have been settled well before May. He had then asked two further questions: \u201cDid Schr\u00f6der want to resign because he had been offered lucrative positions? Did he have personal motives in deciding to call early elections in a politically desperate situation?\u201d According to the statement, Mr Thiele had agreed for his comments to be quoted. On 14 December 2005 the journalist called Mr Thiele again and asked him whether, in the light of the warning (Abmahnung) which Mr Schr\u00f6der had issued to Bild, he still stood by his comments; Mr Thiele confirmed that he did.\n\nB. The impugned article\n\nIn its edition of 12 December 2005 Bild published a front-page article with the headline: \u201cWhat does he really earn from the pipeline project? Schr\u00f6der must reveal his Russian salary.\u201d On page 2 of the newspaper, under the headline \u201cRussian salary \u2013 will Schr\u00f6der earn more than a million a year?\u201d the article read as follows: \u201cThe ex-Chancellor and Russian gas: there is growing outrage among all political parties. For Schr\u00f6der is to head the supervisory board of a business seeking to build a four-billion-euro gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. While he was Chancellor, he pushed this project through despite considerable resistance. Lower Saxony Prime Minister Christian Wulff (CDU) called on Schr\u00f6der to act, either by declining the chairmanship of the NEGP consortium\u2019s supervisory board, or by revealing all his income from his Russian job! Wulff told Bild: \u2018Through his behaviour Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has seriously damaged the reputation of politics in Germany. Schr\u00f6der must decline the job of supervisory board chairman, because otherwise this may create the impression of being a reward for promoting the pipeline.\u2019 The politician added: \u2018If Schr\u00f6der nevertheless accepts his appointment to the supervisory board, he must disclose what he is getting paid. This is a requirement under the regulations on disclosure [of income], which were toughened up by the Schr\u00f6der government this year. The fact that the pipeline company has its headquarters in Switzerland is no reason for the former Federal Chancellor not to abide by these rules.\u2019 Insiders reckon that Schr\u00f6der is pocketing more than a million dollars a year for his gas job. After all, the Russians are not stingy. For example, five supervisory board members of the Russian company Northgas, a Gazprom subsidiary, have received payments totalling seven million dollars. The fact that Schr\u00f6der is walking into the joint German-Russian venture so soon after leaving the Government has been met with incredulity across all political parties. One particularly delicate matter is that on 11 April the Russian energy giant Gazprom and the German [company] BASF signed a memorandum in Hanover for the joint exploitation of a Russian gas field, in the presence of Schr\u00f6der and Russian head of State Vladimir Putin. Following the signing, the two government leaders stayed up late drinking red wine together. Was Schr\u00f6der\u2019s recruitment to the multinational gas company already being discussed at that time \u2013 six weeks before he called the early elections? The vice-chairman of the FDP parliamentary group, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, said: \u2018That\u2019s a question we need to ask!\u2019 Thiele has a monstrous suspicion: \u2018Did Schr\u00f6der want to resign because he had been offered lucrative positions? Did he have personal motives in deciding to call early elections in a politically desperate situation?\u2019 The early election gambit should \u2018now be seen in a new light\u2019, he added. Peter Ramsauer, chairman of the CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag, said: \u2018You don\u2019t make a deal like that overnight, and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was still Chancellor three weeks ago. He should now lay his cards on the table and say whether these agreements had already been reached while he was in office.\u2019 The vice-chairman of the CDU parliamentary group, Wolfgang Bosbach, added: \u2018Schr\u00f6der should finally say what\u2019s going on (was Sache ist)!\u2019 The economic affairs spokesperson for the Greens parliamentary group, Matthias Berninger, said: \u2018Schr\u00f6der must now ensure maximum transparency and disclose his contract and remuneration.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe article on page 2 was accompanied by a photograph of Mr Schr\u00f6der wearing a chapka on his head. Further down there was a short article stating that the NEGP consortium was headed by a former major from the State Security Ministry of the former German Democratic Republic, who was a friend of Mr Putin.\n\nMr Schr\u00f6der\u2019s appointment as chairman of the supervisory board gave rise to public debate and was reported in the media and discussed in the German Parliament, in particular on 15 December 2005.\n\nAn article published in Focus magazine (no. 50/2005) on 12 December 2005 stated that a journalist from the magazine had contacted the Schr\u00f6der government in August 2005 to find out whether indications from Moscow that Gazprom was preparing a post for Mr Schr\u00f6der were true. The government spokesperson had said that this was absurd and denied the existence of any such offer.\n\nIn April 2006 it emerged that in late October 2005, while government business was still being conducted on an interim basis by the outgoing government pending Ms Merkel\u2019s election as Chancellor, guarantees had been signed whereby the German government agreed to underwrite a loan of one billion euros from two German banks in favour of Gazprom and part of the pipeline. Mr Schr\u00f6der indicated that he had had no knowledge of the signing of the guarantees and Gazprom stated that it had not made use of them.\n\nC. The proceedings in issue\n\nOn an unspecified date in 2006 Gerhard Schr\u00f6der sought an injunction in the Hamburg Regional Court prohibiting any further publication of the following passage of the article: \u201cThiele has a monstrous suspicion: \u2018Did Schr\u00f6der want to resign because he had been offered lucrative positions? Did he have personal motives in deciding to call early elections in a politically desperate situation?\u2019\u201d\n\n1. The Regional Court\u2019s judgment\n\nIn a judgment of 24 June 2005 the Regional Court granted the injunction. It held in particular that the quotation in issue was neither a factual allegation nor a value judgment but mere speculation in the form of questions, the legality of which was a matter for assessment in the light of the principles established for reporting on suspicions (Verdachtsberichterstattung). According to these criteria, the courts had to assess whether the impugned report concerned a matter of public interest, whether there was a sufficient factual basis for the speculation, whether the newspaper had been sufficiently diligent in carrying out its research and in deciding to publish the report, and whether the nature of the report made it sufficiently clear that what was being reported was speculation and that the factual reality might be different. The regional court held that the publication of the passage in issue in the case before it did not satisfy these criteria in so far as the applicant company had not sought to obtain Mr Schr\u00f6der\u2019s views on the matter beforehand and had not established a sufficient factual basis to justify publishing the passage in question.\n\n2. Judgment of the Court of Appeal\n\nIn a judgment of 8 April 2008 the Hamburg Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court\u2019s judgment. It held that the publication of the offending quotation breached Article 823 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code, in conjunction with Article 1004 \u00a7 1 (by analogy) of the Civil Code and the right to protection of personality rights (Allgemeines Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrecht \u2013 see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d), because it suggested to readers of the newspaper that Chancellor Schr\u00f6der had taken the decision to hold early parliamentary elections on the basis of private considerations motivated by self-interest. The Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to determine whether the quotation in issue amounted to a genuine (open) question or a factual allegation in the form of a question, since the applicant company had conveyed a suspicion which could also have been formulated as a question. The Regional Court had thus been correct in applying the criteria for reporting on suspicions.\n\nThe Court of Appeal observed that the report published by the applicant company did not merely reproduce what Mr Thiele had said, but the quotation had formed part of a significantly longer article intended to steer readers in a certain direction. It further pointed out that the article had begun by saying that Mr Schr\u00f6der and the Russian President Putin had met in April 2005, and had then asked whether Chancellor Schr\u00f6der\u2019s activities on behalf of Gazprom had been discussed on that occasion. In the court\u2019s view, this encouraged readers to believe that it was possible that an agreement had been reached for Mr Schr\u00f6der to take up a private-sector post and that he had used the election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia as a pretext for triggering a series of events that would lead to his leaving office as Chancellor. It added that this line of thinking was borne out by the two questions in the quotation in issue and the use of the phrases \u201cearly election gambit\u201d and \u201cmust now be seen in a new light\u201d.\n\nThe Court of Appeal observed that the principles for reporting on suspicions applied to the case before it, although the report in question had not contained any suspicion that Mr Schr\u00f6der had committed a criminal offence. What was decisive in the court\u2019s view was that the applicant company had conveyed a suspicion entailing a serious and damaging accusation against the former Chancellor. The article had suggested that he had misled the general public and the electorate about the true reasons for his decision to call early elections and that he had prioritised his own financial interests over the common good, which he was required to serve as Federal Chancellor. The Court of Appeal considered that this was one of the most serious accusations that could be levelled against a person who had formerly held one of the highest State offices. In its view, the quotation in issue confirmed the seriousness of the accusation by using the phrase \u201cmonstrous suspicion\u201d.\n\nThe Court of Appeal added that the applicant company had not had due regard to the principles established for reporting on suspicions. According to these principles, any such reports had to concern a matter of justifiable public interest, have a minimum factual basis, set out the facts objectively by indicating both the circumstances supporting the suspicion and those pleading in favour of the person under suspicion, be published, in principle, after obtaining comments about the accusations from the person concerned and be the result of research satisfying the requirements of journalistic rigour.\n\nApplying those principles to the case before it, the Court of Appeal noted firstly that the subject-matter of the report was in the public interest. It also accepted that there had been sufficient material to justify reporting on the suspicions in question. In that connection, it recapitulated the sequence of events forming the background to the article, namely that Mr Schr\u00f6der had expressed support for the pipeline project throughout his time as Chancellor, that he had met President Putin at the signing of the declaration of 11 April 2005 by two Russian and German private-sector firms, that he had decided to hold early elections at a time when his political party had been in difficulty following its election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia, that he had triggered a process resulting in his relinquishing the office of Chancellor and that \u2013 according to the Court of Appeal \u2013 it had emerged that between the date of the early elections and his last day as Chancellor, Mr Schr\u00f6der had secured a very well-paid post in a consortium controlled by Gazprom.\n\nThe Court of Appeal added that it was especially legitimate to ask how Mr Schr\u00f6der could have secured that post as the events in question belonged to an area of fundamental importance in shaping public opinion. It pointed out that the requirements for assessing the legitimacy of such a report should not be too stringent. Otherwise, there was a risk that the media would be limited to commenting on politicians\u2019 conduct only where there was substantial evidence corroborating the suspicions raised. Such a restriction, however, was not acceptable in this sphere. The Court of Appeal noted that anyone who attracted public attention, such as politicians, had to accept that the threshold beyond which their conduct could be investigated by the media was lower than that applicable to anyone not in the public domain.\n\nThe Court of Appeal added that the impugned publication had lacked objectivity and balance. It pointed out that the version of events set out in a report should not amount to a prejudgment (Vorverurteilung) of the person concerned. This was not only the case where the report gave the impression that the person had in fact done what he or she was suspected of doing, but also when a report was intentionally biased and distorted the facts for sensationalist purposes, without regard to the circumstances militating in favour of the person concerned. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s view, this was what had happened in the case of the report in issue, since it had made no mention of any factors casting doubt on the accusations made but had referred solely to circumstances corroborating the suspicions, which to a certain extent were concentrated within the offending quotation.\n\nIn this connection the Court of Appeal observed that the report did not mention that the May election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia had considerably weakened the authority of the government majority at federal level and could have constituted a valid reason for asking the electorate, by means of early elections, whether it still supported this majority. Likewise, the report did not mention anywhere that Chancellor Schr\u00f6der had not adopted an attitude of resignation but rather had been active and combative throughout the election campaign. Lastly, the Court of Appeal found that at the time of the article\u2019s publication there had been no information from anyone close to Mr Schr\u00f6der to suggest that he had based his decision to call early elections on grounds that were spurious (sachfremd).\n\nThe Court of Appeal added that the applicant company had no basis for arguing that these circumstances were so well known to readers that there was no need to reiterate them in the report, since the entire article had sought to suggest to readers that there were no circumstances casting doubt on the facts as presented. Similarly, the fact that the subject of the report was of considerable public interest could not exempt the applicant company from its duty to present a balanced account of the facts. On this point, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the applicant company was not prevented from criticising Mr Schr\u00f6der. However, in view of the extremely serious accusation being made, it could have been expected to indicate that the facts had yet to be established.\n\nThe Court of Appeal held, lastly, that the applicant company had not carried out sufficient research before publishing the article. It considered that irrespective of whether the politician quoted in the article should have been required to conduct his own research before raising his questions, the applicant company had had a duty to clarify the facts further before publicly reproducing those questions, which concerned extremely serious allegations. It pointed out that there had been sufficient connecting factors in this regard. For example, the applicant company could have contacted the consortium in Switzerland, Mr Schr\u00f6der himself or one of his team to find out when the post for the former Chancellor had been planned or created, when he had discovered the existence of the post and when and by whom the post had been offered to him. The Court of Appeal added that the fact that other media outlets had reported on similar suspicions could not release the applicant company from its duties. Moreover, the company had not asked Mr Schr\u00f6der for his views. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion, irrespective of whether the views of the person concerned should always be sought when suspicions were being reported, the press had a duty in any event, in order to satisfy the requirements of journalistic rigour, to contact the person concerned when publishing speculation relating to that person\u2019s motives, provided that the person could be reached for comment. The Court of Appeal concluded that this duty had been all the more compelling in the case before it, in view of the especially serious nature of the allegation being made.\n\n3. Decision of the Federal Court of Justice\n\nIn a decision of 13 January 2009 the Federal Court of Justice refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law, holding that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case-law.\n\n4. Decision of the Federal Constitutional Court\n\nOn 18 February 2010 a chamber of the Federal Constitutional Court decided not to accept for adjudication a constitutional appeal by the applicant company (no. 1 BvR 368/09). It declined to give reasons for its decision."}

Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Austrian national, Mr Johann Ferihumer (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 13 September 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr B. Wageneder, a lawyer practising in Ried. The Austrian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr F. Trauttmansdorff.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he had been violated in his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nBy a decision of 14 February 2006, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nNeither the applicant nor the Government filed further written observations (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Waizenkirchen.\n\nAt the time of the events, he was the father of a pupil of a secondary school in Grieskirchen (Bundesoberstufenrealgymnasium) and vice-chairman and recording clerk (Schriftf\u00fchrer) of the parents' association (Elternverein) at this school.\n\nIn protest against the government's cuts in the education budget, the teachers of this school decided, together with the teaching staff of two other schools, to reduce and shorten school trips for the school year 2001/2002. The pupils and some parents, including the applicant, did not agree with these measures.\n\nThe applicant called for a vote by the School Committee (Schulgemeinschaftsausschuss) of the Grieskirchen secondary school on the question whether the class his son was attending, should go on a one week trip to Tuscany or Prague. The School Committee which is composed of three representatives of the teachers, three parents and three pupils and the director of the school, represents parents and pupils in certain school matters.\n\nThe meeting at which the School Committee should have to vote on the question, after having been once postponed because one of the teachers' representatives could not participate, was finally fixed for 22 January 2002.\n\nOn 22 January 2002, before the meeting of the School Committee, the chair of the parents' association on behalf of the parents, the pupils' spokesperson on behalf of the pupils and two representatives of the teachers signed a compromise which provided for only a one-day school excursion per class during the school year 2001/2002 and for compensatory school trips in the autumn of 2003.\n\nOn this day the applicant stated before a journalist of the \u201cOber\u00f6sterreicher Rundschau\u201d, a local newspaper for Upper Austria, that this conflict (between the teachers, parents and pupils concerning the boycott measures) was carried out to the detriment of the pupils and that the teachers were applying pressure on the pupils and parents to an intolerable extent and that this amounted in fact to an abuse of their authority.\n\nOn 24 January 2002 the \u201cOber\u00f6sterreicher Rundschau\u201d published an article which stated inter alia: \u201c 'This conflict is carried out to the detriment of the pupils' blusters professor Johannes Ferihumer, representative of the parents and former teacher at the secondary school. 'Not only this: the teachers apply pressure on pupils and parents to an intolerable extent. This amounts in fact to an abuse of their authority. Who is surprised that the school speaker was at the end of her tether.' \u201d\n\nThe majority of teachers of the Grieskirchen secondary school brought proceedings against the applicant for insult and damage to their reputation before the Peuersbach District Court.\n\nThe Peuersbach District Court heard the applicant, the teachers, the spokesperson of the pupils, the chair of the parents' association and several other witnesses.\n\nBy judgment of 9 October 2002, it ordered the applicant to refrain from repeating the statement that the teachers were applying pressure on the pupils and parents to an intolerable extent and that this amounted in fact to an abuse of their authority. It noted that the statement was an insult and a defamation within the meaning of Article 1330 of the Civil Code. The applicant had to accept the most unfavourable interpretation of this statement which meant that the teachers had used unlawful and unobjective means in order to make parents and pupils agree to the boycott measures. The applicant had, however, failed to submit any evidence to prove this reproach. The court noted that it was true that, in the course of time the atmosphere between the pupils and teachers at the Grieskirchen secondary school had been strained. The spokesperson of the pupils had complained that the teachers did not take her seriously and avoided any discussion about the boycott measures with her. She had, therefore, resigned from her function as spokesperson. The court further observed that the conflicting interests of teachers, parents and pupils in regard to the boycott measures naturally caused tensions. There was, however, no indication that the teachers had used unlawful and unobjective means, such as, for example, the use of their authority to assign marks, in order to make the parents and pupils agree to the compromise. It was, on the contrary, because of the teachers' unbending attitude concerning the boycott measures that pupils and parents had finally resigned and agreed to the compromise.\n\nThe court dismissed the teachers' further request for an injunction as regards the applicant's statement that the conflict was detrimental to the pupils.\n\nThe applicant appealed against this decision. He submitted inter alia that he had alluded to the subtle measures the teachers had employed in order to reach a compromise, such as their threat to boycott the meeting of the School Committee and their tactics to undermine the authority of the pupils' spokesperson. This was contrary to their official duties and, therefore, unlawful. He further referred their successful tactics to delay the meeting of the School Committee, the testimony of some pupils who had stated that they had felt under pressure and the fact that, in the context of the discussions concerning the boycott measures, both the pupils' spokesperson and the chair of the parents' association had resigned from their functions. The statement at issue was a value judgment with sufficient factual basis and was protected by his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. From the context of the situation in which the statements had been made, it was clear that he had referred to the pressure which had led to the signing of a compromise. Neither the concerned pupils, nor the parents had understood his criticism to the effect that the teachers had applied psychical or verbal violence or had applied pressure by their authority to assign marks. Furthermore, the teachers had themselves attracted the attention of the public by their boycott measures which had provoked criticism and resistance.\n\nOn 5 February 2003 the Wels Regional Court dismissed the appeal. It noted that the statement at issue constituted a statement of fact susceptible of proof. The applicant had failed to prove that the statement was true. The injunction at issue did, therefore, not violate the applicant's right to freedom of expression. The court further ordered the applicant to pay the costs of the proceedings. This decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 13 March 2003."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 60177/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Osman \u00d6z\u00fcpek, Mr Duran \u00d6zdemir and Mr H\u00fcseyin Avni Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 16 March 1999.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Ms A. Stock, Mr M. Muller, Mr Tim Otty and Mr K. Y\u0131ld\u0131z of the Kurdish Human Rights Project (London). The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 27 April 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the applicants\u2019 right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1973, 1965 and 1960 respectively. The first and second applicants live in Ankara and the third applicant lives in Trabzon.\n\nThe applicants were employed by the Culture and Education Department of the Sincan District Council in Ankara and were involved in the organisation of public activities and events during religious and national days. Upon the instructions of the mayor and the deputy mayor, the applicants organised on 31 January 1997 a special night called the \u201cJerusalem Night\u201d during the month of Ramadan. The event was announced months in advance and representatives of the security forces and several important personalities living in the district were invited. The hall was decorated with posters of martyrs who had given their lives for the liberation of Jerusalem. The applicants also organised a five-minute play for the evening. The second applicant cleaned the hall, set up and maintained the sound system and welcomed the guests. The play, which was written by the first and third applicants, took the form of a conversation between a father and his son about life in Palestine and the struggle of the Palestinian people. The first applicant played the role of the father in the play. The mayor of Sincan and the Ambassador to Iran made speeches before the play began.\n\nThe second and third applicants were taken into police custody on 5 February 1997 and the first applicant on 6 February 1997. They were accused of disseminating propaganda in support of an armed, illegal organisation, namely the Hezbollah. During their police interrogations, the applicants denied the charges against them.\n\nOn 13 February 1997 the applicants were brought before the public prosecutor. During their questioning, they repeated the statements they had made at the police station.\n\nOn the same day the applicants were brought before the investigating judge attached to the Ankara State Security Court, where they made similar statements. Subsequently, the investigating judge ordered that the applicants be remanded in custody.\n\nIn an indictment dated 7 March 1997, the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants. It was alleged that they had disseminated propaganda in support of an armed, illegal organisation. The prosecution therefore called for the applicants to be sentenced pursuant to Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Law.\n\nOn 15 October 1997 the Ankara State Security Court, which was composed of three judges including a military judge, found that the applicants had aided and abetted a terrorist organisation by engaging in propaganda in support thereof. It found the applicants guilty as charged, sentenced them to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment and debarred them from public service for three years.\n\nOn 21 September 1998 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the Ankara State Security Court."}

case originated in an application (no. 8932/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Ms Krystyna Sia\u0142kowska (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 February 2005.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Ms Bogdana S\u0142upska-Uczkiewicz, a lawyer practising in Wroc\u0142aw. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Jakub Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the proceedings had been unfair in that she had been denied effective access to a court. She referred to the fact that the lawyer appointed under applicable legal aid scheme had failed to undertake the necessary steps to represent her interest effectively in that he had refused to bring the cassation appeal to the Supreme Court against a judgment of the appellate court.\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nThe Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the proceedings in the present case should be conducted simultaneously with those in the case of Staroszczyk v. Poland (application no. 59519/00).\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe and from the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 \u00a7 2).\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 15 June 2006 (Rule 54 \u00a7 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr Jakub Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, Ambassador, Agent, Ms Ma\u0142gorzata Kosicka, Legal Expert, Counsel, Ms Eliza Sucho\u017cebrska, Third Secratary, Adviser; (b) for the applicants Mr Wojciech Hermeli\u0144ski, Ms Bogdana S\u0142upska-Uczkiewicz, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr Jakub Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, Mr Wojciech Hermeli\u0144ski, Ms Bogdana S\u0142upska-Uczkiewicz and Ms Eliza Sucho\u017cebrska.\n\nBy a decision of 15 June 2006, following the hearing on admissibility and the merits, the Court declared the application partly admissible. It joined the examination of the Government's objections as regards incompatibility ratione personae and exhaustion of domestic remedies to the merits of the case.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Wroc\u0142aw.\n\nAfter the applicant's husband had died in September 2002, she instituted proceedings in which she claimed her widow pension.\n\nBy a decision of 3 October 2002, the social insurance authority dismissed her request.\n\nOn 4 March 2003 the Wroclaw Regional Court dismissed her appeal against this decision. On 2 September 2004 the Wroclaw Court of Appeal dismissed her further appeal.\n\nThe appellate court observed that the findings of fact made by the social insurance authority were correct. The applicant and her husband had de facto separated in 1994. He had been living since then with another woman. The applicant had not been receiving any maintenance payments from him. When he had fallen ill, she had not been taking care of him and she had been informed of his poor health only in March 2002. The court considered that the lower court had not erred when it assessed the testimony of one witness, who had submitted that the couple had been living together, as not being credible. The appellate court concluded that the legal requirements for granting a widow pension were not complied with.\n\nThe applicant requested that legal aid for the purposes of lodging a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court be granted to her and her request was allowed. The court requested the local Bar Association to assign a lawyer to the case and advocate Z.W. was so assigned on 17 September 2004.\n\nThe copy of the judgment of the appellate court was served on Z.W. on 9 November 2004.\n\nBy a written opinion of one page and a half dated 3 December 2004 Z.W. advised the applicant that, in his view, a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court did not offer reasonable prospect of success. He referred to the written grounds of the judgment of the appellate court by which that court had explained why the applicant had not complied with the requirements of the applicable law, and considered that in the light of the evidence examined by the courts, there were no grounds on which to argue that the second-instance judgment was in breach of the law. Consequently, he did not draw up the cassation appeal.\n\nThe opinion contained the following paragraph: \u201cI would like to stress that the judgment of the Wroclaw Court of Appeal of 2 September was served on me on 9 October (sic) 2004 and that the thirty-day time-limit for the lodging of a cassation appeal expires on 9 December 2004.\u201d\n\nOn 6 December 2004 the applicant had a meeting with the lawyer at his office. He gave her his opinion and informed her that he saw no grounds on which to prepare a cassation appeal in her case. On the same occasion the applicant was served with the copy of the appellate court's judgment with its written grounds."}

Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Irish national, Mr Gerard Patrick O\u2019Hara (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 20 May 1997.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by his counsel. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged principally that he had not been arrested on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence, that he had not been brought promptly before a judge or other judicial officer and that he did not have an enforceable right to compensation in respect of these matters. He relied on Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 and 5 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11). The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 14 March 2000, the Chamber declared the application partly admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court\u2019s decision is obtainable from the Registry].\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 12 June 2001 (Rule 59 \u00a7 2). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr H. Llewellyn, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr S. Freeland, Counsel, Mr O. Paulin, Mr S. Braviner, Mrs M. Madden, Advisers; (b) for the applicant Mr B. MacDonald, Counsel, Mr D. Mullan, of the Londonderry Bar, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr MacDonald and Mr Freeland.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was, and still is, a prominent member of Sinn Fein. He has been arrested by the police on a number of occasions and has issued proceedings relating to his allegations, inter alia, of arbitrary arrest, assault and ill-treatment arising out of six incidents. In proceedings lodged for incidents in 1988 and on 19 March 1993, he received an award of damages (amount unspecified). In or about January 1994 he was awarded damages of 2,500 pounds sterling (GBP) for an incident in Guildhall Square on 16 March 1993 when the judge found that he had been wrongfully arrested by police officers who had purported to arrest the applicant for obstruction in failing to give his name when in fact they were fully aware of his identity. This case concerns his arrest in 1985 in relation to the murder of Mr Kurt Konig.\n\nKurt Konig was a German citizen working for the caterers of canteens in police stations in Londonderry. He was murdered on 21 November 1985. The Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for his death.\n\nThe Government submitted that Special Branch received intelligence that the applicant and three other persons were involved in the murder. The intelligence derived from four informants who had proved reliable in the past and had provided information leading to seizures of explosives or firearms and to prosecutions. None of the informants had a criminal record. The information given by these four informants was consistent, in that all gave the same names as being involved, and independent, in that none was aware of the existence of the others and each gave the information at separate meetings with police officers.\n\nDetective Superintendent R. of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (\u201cthe RUC\u201d) was briefed by Special Branch concerning this intelligence that the applicant was a member of the Provisional IRA and had been implicated in the murder.\n\nDetective Superintendent R. briefed Inspector B. who in turn briefed Detective Constable S.\n\nOn 28 December 1985, at about 6 or 6.15 a.m., Detective Constable S. visited the applicant\u2019s house and conducted a search. At the conclusion of the search, at 8.05 a.m., S. arrested the applicant. He told the applicant that he was arresting him under section 12(1)(b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 (\u201cthe 1984 Act\u201d) which empowered a police constable to arrest, without a warrant, a person whom he had reasonable grounds for suspecting of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.\n\nThe applicant was taken to Castlereagh Detention Centre where he was questioned about his possible membership of the IRA, his suspected involvement in Kurt Konig\u2019s murder and also his possible involvement in the murder of two soldiers on 1 April 1982. He was interviewed on thirty-four occasions. He did not respond to any questions. According to the Government, the first interview occurred on 28 December 1985 at 11.50 a.m., at the start of which he was told that the police were enquiring into his involvement with the Provisional IRA and related matters. Police notes provided by the Government record that during the next interview, from 2.05 to 4 p.m., the interrogating officers told the applicant that they were making enquiries in relation to his membership of the IRA and the murder of Kurt Konig.\n\nOn 29 December 1985 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland extended the applicant\u2019s period of detention beyond the initial 48-hour period, by five days. The applicant was released without charge on 3 January 1986 at 9 p.m., after six days and thirteen hours in custody.\n\nBy a writ issued on 20 August 1986 against the Chief Constable of the RUC, the applicant instituted a civil action for damages before the High Court in Northern Ireland in respect of, inter alia, assault, seizure of documents, false imprisonment and unlawful arrest.\n\nBefore the High Court, the submissions of the applicant\u2019s counsel concentrated, as the trial judge found, on the issues of assault and confiscation of documents. He did however raise the argument, in the context of the lawfulness of the arrest, that Detective Constable S. did not have sufficient grounds for suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence to justify the arrest. The evidence before the court from Detective Constable S. was to the effect that he attended a briefing at 5.30 a.m. on 28 December 1985 in which he was told that he was to carry out a search to find evidence and arrest persons, including the applicant, suspected of involvement in the murder of Kurt Konig. He had been told by his superior officer, Inspector B., at that briefing that the applicant was involved in the murder and stated that these were the reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant. He did not state that Inspector B. had told him the grounds for his own suspicion, nor was he asked about that matter by counsel for either party. It was common ground that the murder was a terrorist offence. The superior officer was not called as a witness in the proceedings.\n\nOn 14 November 1990 Judge McCollum found that there had been an unlawful taking of the applicant\u2019s notes by a police officer and awarded Mr O\u2019Hara GBP 100 in damages. He rejected the applicant\u2019s claims of assault and ill-treatment, finding that he had not satisfied him on the balance of probabilities that his version of events was right and that of the police officers wrong. As regards the allegations of wrongful arrest, the judge noted: \u201c... while [the applicant\u2019s counsel] submitted that the officer who arrested the [applicant] was required, in order to render the arrest lawful, in addition to holding the suspicion grounding the arrest of the [applicant], [to] have reasonable grounds for that suspicion, based on his own knowledge of facts giving rise to that suspicion. He accepted that both Mr Justice Carswell and the Lord Chief Justice had previously rejected the same submission in similar cases. While he reserved his position on this issue he made no new submissions and produced no new arguments to me which would cause me to depart from the reasoning in their decisions, and in the circumstances I am satisfied in this case on the evidence of Detective Constable [S.] that as a result of the information he had been given he had reasonable grounds for suspecting that the [applicant] had been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Cross-examination of the detective constable did not probe the details which had been disclosed to Detective Constable [S.] in the course of the briefing during which he was supplied with this information. I find on the evidence that the detective constable had a suspicion that the [applicant] was involved in the murder of Kurt Konig and that this suspicion was reasonably based on information given to him by a superior officers at the briefing that morning. Either party could have elicited details of the briefing, not as truth of the matters disclosed, but as relevant on the issue of the reasonableness of the suspicion held by the arresting officer. Proof of the lawfulness of the arrest lies on the defendant. I would not wish to lay down the proposition that reasonable suspicion could in all circumstances be based on the opinion of another officer expressed without any supporting allegations of fact. But it does seem to me that a briefing officially given by a superior officer would give reasonable grounds for suspicion of the matters stated therein. The fact that I have such scanty evidence of the matters disclosed to Detective Constable [S.] means that I am only just satisfied of the legality of the arrest, but I am fortified in my view by the lack of detailed challenge in cross-examination as to the nature of the information given to him. The main issue between the parties is as to whether the [applicant] was assaulted and mistreated during the period of his detention ...\u201d\n\nOn 24 October 1990, the applicant gave notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland concerning the claim of unlawful arrest and false imprisonment.\n\nOn 6 May 1994 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, upholding the decision of the High Court that reasonable suspicion could be derived from information provided by a superior officer and that the arrest was lawful. \u201cNotwithstanding his concern that more detail of the briefing had not been given, the learned trial judge was able to conclude: \u2018(1) that the arresting officer ... did have a suspicion that the [applicant] was involved in a terrorist murder and it was implicit that that suspicion was genuinely held by him; and (2) that the official briefing which he had attended given by [his superior officer] gave him reasonable grounds for that suspicion.\u2019 These were factual findings and clearly contained in our view all the essential proofs that the respondent was required to adduce to constitute lawful arrest under section 12(1)(b) of the Act. [Applicant\u2019s counsel] submitted that this was not the case. The source of the suspicion and the reasonable grounds for it must be before the court, namely evidence from the briefing officer, Inspector [B.], as to the grounds on which he suspected the [applicant] of being involved in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. It would be unjust, he contended, if section 12 could give Inspector [B.] protection from liability for false imprisonment if the Inspector himself had not reasonable grounds for the suspicion. The first part of this submission flies in the face of the authorities as we have said. The second part, so far as this case is concerned, seems to be hypothetical in that the regularity or the bona fides of the \u2018official briefing\u2019 were not questioned. No factual foundation for such a case was made out ... We consider that the decision of the learned trial judge was correct. The information given at the briefing to the arresting officer was admissible and although, in his words, \u2018scanty\u2019 it was sufficient to constitute the required state of mind of an arresting officer under section 12(1)(b) of the Act.\u201d\n\nAn appeal to the House of Lords against the decision of the Court of Appeal was dismissed on 12 December 1996. In his judgment, with which the other judges agreed, Lord Hope of Craighead held that it was not necessary for an arresting officer to possess all the information which had led to the decision to arrest, but that the arresting officer must have equipped himself with sufficient information so that he had reasonable cause to suspect before exercising the power of arrest. The information acted upon by the arresting officer need not be based on his own observations, as he is entitled to form a suspicion based on what he has been told; his reasonable suspicion may be based on information which has been given to him anonymously, or it may be based on information which turns out later to be wrong. While the evidence about the matters disclosed at the briefing was indeed scanty, he found that the trial judge was entitled to weigh up the evidence in the light of the surrounding circumstances and, having regard to the source of that information, and to draw inferences as to what a reasonable man, in the position of the independent observer, would make of it.\n\nLord Steyn stated, inter alia, concerning the general principles: \u201cCertain general propositions about the powers of constables under a section such as section 12(1) can now be summarised. (1) In order to have a reasonable suspicion the constable need not have evidence amounting to a prima facie case. Ex hypothesis one is considering a preliminary stage of the investigation and information from an informer or a tip-off from a member of the public may be enough: Hussien v. Chong Fook Kam [1970] A.C. 942, 949. (2) Hearsay information may therefore afford a constable reasonable grounds to arrest. Such information may come from other officers ... (3) The information which causes the constable to be suspicious of the individual must be in existence to the knowledge of the police officer at the time he makes the arrest. (4) The executive \u2018discretion\u2019 to arrest or not ... vests in the constable, who is engaged on the decision to arrest or not, and not in his superior officers. Given the independent responsibility and accountability of a constable under a provision such as section 12(1) of the Act of 1984 it seems to follow that the mere fact that an arresting officer has been instructed by a superior officer to effect the arrest is not capable of amounting to reasonable grounds for the necessary suspicion within the meaning of section 12(1). It is accepted, and rightly accepted, that a mere request to arrest without any further information by an equal ranking officer, or a junior officer, is incapable of amounting to reasonable grounds for the necessary suspicion. How can the badge of superior officers and the fact that he gave an order make a difference? ... In practice it follows that a constable must be given some basis for a request to arrest someone under a provision such as section 12(1), e.g. a report from an informer.\u201d"}

Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Fehmi Ko\u00e7 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 October 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr F. G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 8 July 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and he is currently detained in the Diyarbak\u0131r Prison.\n\nOn 12 March 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 10 April 1995 he was brought before a single judge of the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court who ordered his detention on remand. In the course of the proceedings before the court, the applicant denied the statements that he had signed while he was in police custody.\n\nOn 13 April 1995 the chief public prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with the latter charging the applicant and sixteen other suspects, under Article 125 of the Criminal Code, with carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory.\n\nIn the course of the criminal proceedings, the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court held thirty hearings and heard seventeen witnesses.\n\nOn 3 June 1999 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court composed of two civilian judges and a military judge, convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to death under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. Taking into account the applicant's conduct during the trial, the death penalty was commuted to a life sentence.\n\nOn 4 June 1999 the applicant appealed against the judgment of the State Security Court.\n\nOn 21 February 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the State Security Court.\n\nOn 5 May 2000 the Court of Cassation's decision was deposited with the registry of the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court."}

the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Miroslaw Czaus (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 27 May 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr J. Szczechowicz, a lawyer practising in Olsztyn. The Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 3 April 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Olsztyn, Poland.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nA. The first set of civil proceedings against Ms J.R. and Mr G.M.\n\nOn 12 September 2000 the applicant instituted before the Olsztyn Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) civil proceedings against Ms J.R. and Mr G.M. in which he claimed payment for construction work he had carried out. The applicant requested that his claim be considered in a summary procedure (post\u0119powanie nakazowe).\n\nOn 10 October 2000 the court allowed the action and issued a payment order against the defendant. The defendant appealed.\n\nSubsequently, all the judges of the Olsztyn Regional Court asked to be excluded from trying the case as the defendant was married to one of the judges. The case was thus transferred to the Warsaw Regional Court where it was filed under case no. XV GC 375/01.\n\nThe court held the first hearing on 8 October 2002. The next hearings were held on 20 February and 28 November 2003.\n\nOn 27 May 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment in which it allowed a part of the applicant's action.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment.\n\nOn 22 August 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint about a breach of the right to have his case heard within a reasonable time. He relied on the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d).\n\nOn 24 August 2005 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) held the first hearing.\n\nOn 3 October 2005 the Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed the complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings. The court established that the Regional Court had been inactive for many months which led to the unjustified protraction of the proceedings. However, the inactivity occurred before the entry into force of the 2004 Act and thus could not be taken into consideration.\n\nThe proceedings on the merits of the applicant's civil action are pending before the appeal court.\n\nB. The second and third set of civil proceedings\n\nIn July 1999 the applicant lodged civil proceedings for payment with the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) against the limited liability company \u201cAuto \u017boliborz\u201d.\n\nOn 31 January 2003 the court gave a judgment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 7 May 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 24 May 2005 the Warsaw District Court gave a judgment.\n\nThe appeal lodged against this judgment was rejected on 18 October 2005 as it had been lodged out of time.\n\nOn 17 May 2001 the applicant initiated another set of civil proceedings against Mr A.S. and Mr J.C.\n\nOn 17 May 2001 the Olsztyn District Court gave a judgment in which it partly allowed the applicant's action. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 3 March 2003 the Olsztyn Regional Court partly allowed the appeal."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41012/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Andrzej Makowski (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 10 October 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr X. Oster, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 May 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Mys\u0142owice.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention on remand\n\nOn 4 October 2002 the applicant was arrested in Blanes, Spain, under an international search and arrest warrant on suspicion of having committed several offences of fraud, forgery, perjury, uttering threats, robbery and kidnapping, while acting in an organised criminal group. On 12 February 2002 the Central Investigating Court in Madrid no. 3 (Juzgado Central de Instrucci\u00f3n) granted a request for the applicant\u2019s extradition. On 28 April 2003 the applicant was brought to Poland.\n\nOn 30 April 2003 the Katowice District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) remanded him in custody until 30 June 2003. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. It further referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and to the risk that he might go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court stressed that this had happened before and had given rise to the issue of the international search and arrest warrant and to the extradition proceedings.\n\nOn 23 September 2003 the Katowice District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 30 October 2003. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question, the severity of the anticipated sentence, the fear that he might tamper with evidence and the complexity of the case. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 29 October 2003 the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.\n\nThe applicant maintains that when he was detained between 28 April 2003 and 1 April 2004 he was forced to testify, subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment and that the conditions of his detention were poor. Moreover, he maintains that he was deprived of contact with his family.\n\nOn 20 December 2004 the applicant was indicted before the Katowice District Court. The bill of indictment listed several charges of fraud, forgery, perjury, robbery and kidnapping brought against thirteen accused, committed in the context of an organised criminal group.\n\nOn 28 December 2004 the Katowice District Court further extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 30 June 2005. The court considered that the reasons for keeping him in detention were still valid. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 9 March 2005 the Katowice Regional Court partly amended the decision of the district court and reduced the further period of his detention, fixing the deadline for 27 April 2005.\n\nOn 20 April 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 27 August 2005.\n\nAt the first hearing, held on 23 May 2005, the Katowice District Court found that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the case and referred it to the Katowice Regional Court.\n\nOn 2 June 2005 the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice (Ministerstwo Sprawiedliwosci) about delays in the proceedings and his extradition from Spain. His complaint was referred to the Katowice District Court. In a letter of 30 June 2005 the President of the Katowice District Court informed the applicant that the trial court had dealt promptly with the case, which was very complex.\n\nOn 27 June 2005 the applicant made an application for release. He requested that his detention be replaced by another preventive measure.\n\nOn 8 July 2005 the Katowice District Court dismissed the application. The court found that the evidence obtained in the case sufficiently supported the charges laid against him. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. The court stressed that the fact that the applicant had acted in an organised criminal group posed in itself a risk of his obstructing the proper course of the proceedings.\n\nOn 24 August 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 30 March 2006. The court repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.\n\nOn 12 December 2005 the Katowice Regional Court found that the District Court was competent to deal with the applicant\u2019s case and referred it back to the Katowice District Court.\n\nOn 16 January 2006 the Katowice District Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s application for release or as an alternative the replacement of detention by more lenient preventive measures. On 27 February 2006 the Katowice Regional Court upheld that decision. The court repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.\n\nThe hearings scheduled for 21 April, 5 May and 19 May 2006 were adjourned.\n\nOn 29 March 2006 the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant\u2019s detention until 30 August 2006. On 23 August 2006 that court ordered his continued detention until 30 December 2006. The applicant\u2019s appeal was dismissed on 27 September 2006 by the Katowice Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 2 June 2006 the court held the first hearing on the merits.\n\nOn 1 December 2006 the Katowice District Court released the applicant under police supervision. It also ordered that the applicant be forbidden to leave his place of residence. The proceedings are still pending.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 13 January 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d).\n\nOn 22 February 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed his complaint. The court examined only the proceedings before the Regional Court, namely from 17 August 2005 to 12 December 2005, and held that there were no delays for which the Regional Court could be held responsible. It noted that the court, when deciding on administrative and procedural matters, acted without delay. It further considered irrelevant the fact that at the material time the trial had not yet commenced.\n\nAs regards the proceedings before the Katowice District Court, which began on 20 December 2004 and which are still pending before it, the Court of Appeal referred this part of the complaint to the Katowice Regional Court for consideration. On 17 May 2006 the Katowice Regional Court discontinued the proceedings, since the applicant had withdrawn his complaint on 5 May 2006 about the length of the proceedings before the District Court."}

Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Ms Halina Maria \u0141o\u015b (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 7 June 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Henryk Szulejewski, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that her detention on remand had exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 30 January 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3) and to examine it simultaneously with the case of Fi\u0142on v. Poland (no. 39163/06), which concerned the same criminal proceedings.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Warsaw. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and her detention on remand\n\nOn 10 June 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud, committed in an organised criminal group.\n\nOn 11 June 2003 the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) remanded her in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that she had committed the offence in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that she might tamper with evidence and induce witnesses to give false testimony. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s appeal against the detention order, likewise her further appeals against decisions prolonging her detention and all her subsequent, numerous applications for release, were unsuccessful. In her applications and appeals, she argued that the charge against her was based on unreliable and contradictory evidence. She also relied on her personal circumstances, in particular her age.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the applicant\u2019s detention was prolonged on several occasions by the Warsaw District Court (on 11 June 2003, 3 September 2003, 3 December 2003 and by the Warsaw Court of Appeal (on 8 June 2004, 7 September 2004, 3 December 2004, 1 March 2005). In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. They attached importance to the grave nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. They further considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation, especially the need to verify evidence from suspects and witnesses and the need to obtain fresh evidence from experts justified holding her in custody.\n\nOn 12 May 2005 the Pruszk\u00f3w District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) lodged a bill of indictment with the Warsaw District Court. The applicant was charged with fraud, committed in an organised criminal group. There were 16 defendants in the case, all charged with numerous counts of fraud committed in an organised criminal group. On 20 May 2005 the Warsaw District Court again prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention until 9 June 2005 reiterating the grounds previously given for her detention.\n\nSince on 10 June 2005 the applicant\u2019s detention had reached the statutory time-limit of two years laid down in Article 263 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a further prolongation of her detention and also detention of her co-accused E.C., A.F. and P.S until 9 December 2005 was ordered by the Warsaw Court of Appeal on 3 June 2005. The court found that the strong suspicion against her of having committed the serious offences with which she had been charged and the severity of the anticipated sentence justified holding her in custody. It pointed out that the case was complex given the number of accused and the number of charges brought against them. Moreover, it added that 450 witnesses were to be heard and numerous documents were to be examined.\n\nOn 12 August 2005 the trial court held the first hearing. Until 21 December 2006, the date on which the applicant was released from detention, the Warsaw District Court held 44 hearings in the case.\n\nDuring the court proceedings the authorities further prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial. On 25 November 2005 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, on an application of the trial court, prolonged the detention of the applicant until 9 March 2006, reiterating the grounds previously given for her detention. The court found the request for prolongation of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention justified; however, it prolonged it only by three months and not by six months. The court also pointed out that it was possible for the trial court to examine all the evidence within the three\u2011month time-limit and that maximum efforts should be made to expedite the examination of the case. On 7 March 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal prolonged the detention of the applicant until 9 June 2006, reiterating the grounds previously given for her detention. The court pointed out that the three-month time-limit was sufficient for examining the evidence. On 30 May 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal prolonged the detention of the applicant until 9 December 2006. The court stressed the complexity of the case in view of the number of witnesses to be heard. It also pointed out that the trial court should re-consider if it was necessary to hear all the witnesses listed in the bill of indictment. The trial court was instructed to take all necessary measures in order to expedite the proceedings. On 8 December 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention until 31 December 2006. The court relied on the grounds stated in the previous decisions.\n\nOn 21 December 2006 the applicant was released.\n\nThe proceedings are still pending."}

under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Maciej Lisiak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 24 February 1997.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. Sikora, a lawyer practising in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that his right to have a hearing within a \u201creasonable time\u201d had not been respected. He alleged a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nIt was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy a decision of 23 October 2001 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 2 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other\u2019s observations.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a.\n\nA. Facts before 1 May 1993\n\nOn 10 August 1991 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On 12 August 1991 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) charged the applicant with homicide and uttering threats, and detained him on remand.\n\nOn 30 April 1992 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy). The applicant was indicted on the charges of homicide and uttering threats.\n\nThe trial began on 16 June 1992.\n\nOn 14 October 1992 Court quashed the order for the applicant\u2019s detention and released him. The Regional Prosecutor appealed. The Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 4 November 1992. It held that a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged was no longer justified because S.U., the witness who had incriminated him in the investigation, had fundamentally changed his original testimony.\n\nBetween 16 June 1992 and 1 May 1993 the trial court held fourteen hearings. It heard evidence from twenty lay witnesses and one expert witness.\n\nB. Facts after 1 May 1993\n\nBetween 4 May 1993 and 25 May 1994 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court held ten hearings and heard evidence from forty-one witnesses and two experts. It needed to rehear evidence from some witnesses several times.\n\nOn 25 May 1994 the court acquitted the applicant on all charges. On 12 October 1994 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Prosecutor appealed against the acquittal.\n\nThe appeal was heard before the Katowice Court of Appeal on 9 March 1995. The court quashed the contested judgment and remitted the case to the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Prosecutor, holding that a further investigation should be carried out. In particular, the Court of Appeal ordered the prosecutor to reconstruct the scene of the crime and to obtain evidence from experts in psychology. It considered that in order to assess the credibility of evidence given by S.U., the main prosecution witness, it was necessary to diagnose his personality and establish his perception skills.\n\nOn 12 May 1995 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Prosecutor asked the Institute of Forensic Experts (Instytut Ekspertyz S\u0105dowych) in Cracow to prepare a comprehensive report on S.U.\u2019s psychological profile. Furthermore, since in the course of the original investigation the prosecution had already obtained two, albeit inconsistent, reports from psychologists, the prosecutor also adduced copies of those reports and asked experts from the Institute to resolve contradictions.\n\nThe experts set the dates of the examination for 19 December 1995 and for 12 February 1996 respectively. However, S.U. did not keep his appointment for the examination on either of these dates. Eventually, he appeared before the experts on 9 May 1996 and was examined by them on that day. Their report was ready on 6 September 1996.\n\nOn 30 December 1996 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Prosecutor lodged a new bill of indictment with the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Court. The applicant was again indicted on the charges of homicide and uttering threats.\n\nOn 27 March 1997 the trial court remitted the case to the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Prosecutor, holding that the prosecution had not complied with the orders given by the Katowice Court of Appeal on 9 March 1995. They had not, among other things, reconstructed the scene of the crime.\n\nOn 30 April 1997 the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Regional Prosecutor indicted the applicant on the same charges for the third time.\n\nThe retrial started on 4 September 1997. The subsequent hearings were held on 4 November 1997, 6 January and 8 April 1998. On 12 February 1998 the court cancelled a hearing because the applicant was ill.\n\nOn 9 June 1998 the trial was adjourned since a new judge rapporteur had in the meantime been appointed and needed to study the case-file.\n\nThe trial was to be resumed on 26 March 1999 but it was again postponed. The applicant was absent at that hearing. He was also absent at the hearing listed for 7 May 1999. The applicant\u2019s lawyer informed the court that he had left for Greece in search of odd jobs and that he would be absent for some four months. In fact, the applicant returned after three weeks. Also, at that time, the court found that the witness S.U. had left his place of residence without indicating his new address and that his whereabouts were unknown. In the circumstances, the court stayed the proceedings.\n\nOn 7 November 2000, at the applicant\u2019s request, the proceedings were resumed. In 2001 the Regional Court held three hearings. They took place on 20 April, 15 June and 31 October respectively.\n\nFurther hearings were scheduled for 4 January, 6 February, 6 March, 9 April and 14 May 2002. The court heard evidence from twenty witnesses. At the hearing held on 9 April 2002 the court, at the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s request, ordered that evidence from a DNA identification test of several hairs found on the victim be obtained to determine whether they belonged to the applicant. However, on 13 May 2002, experts from the Forensic Laboratory of the Silesian Regional Police Headquarters informed the court that it was not possible for them to make any DNA identification of the specimens as they had to be analysed through a chondrosome test, which only the Cracow Institute of Forensic Experts or the Bydgoszcz Forensic Institute could carry out. On 20 May 2002 the court asked the Cracow Institute to make the relevant test and adjourned the trial sine die. In the meantime, the Regional Court had tried to establish the whereabouts of S.U., who was a homeless person. It appears that those efforts have so far been unsuccessful. The proceedings are pending."}
