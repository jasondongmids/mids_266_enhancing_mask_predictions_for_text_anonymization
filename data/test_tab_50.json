Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by four Turkish nationals, Mr Galip Yalman, Mr Bahattin Sar\u0131soy, Mr Osman \u00c7a\u011flayan and Mr Yusuf \u00c7amca (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 29 November 1996.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr S. Esmer, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicants alleged that their case, which commenced in 1989 and terminated in 1996, was not heard within a reasonable time as required by the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nBy a decision of 15 May 2003, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nIn September 1980 the applicants were taken into police custody and were subsequently placed in detention on remand on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. The Erzincan Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Erzincan Martial Law Court (s\u0131k\u0131y\u00f6netim askeri mahkemesi) charging the applicants under Article 146 of the Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation whose object was to undermine the constitutional order.\n\nOn various dates between 1982 and 1984 the applicants were released pending trial.\n\nOn 13 September 1988 the Erzincan Martial Law Court acquitted the applicants of the charges against them.\n\nOn various dates in March, April and June 1989 the applicants brought individual actions before the Sinop Assize Court against the Treasury, pursuant to Law no. 466. They requested compensation for their unjustified detention on remand.\n\nOn 20 October 1989 the court decided to join the applicants\u2019 cases.\n\nOn 15 December 1993 the Sinop Assize Court awarded non\u2011pecuniary compensation to the applicants. The applicants appealed, arguing that the amount of compensation awarded was not sufficient.\n\nOn 31 January 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court.\n\nOn 6 June 1995 the Sinop Assize Court increased the amount of non\u2011pecuniary compensation.\n\nOn 15 June 1995 the applicants again appealed.\n\nOn 30 May 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the judgment of the assize court."}

Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Turkish nationals, Mr Mehmet B\u00fclent Y\u0131lmaz and Mr \u015eahin Y\u0131lmaz (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 20 May 1998.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr H.\u00c7. Akbulut, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 21 March 2002 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1975 and 1970 respectively.\n\nOn 19 and 20 August 1995 respectively the applicants were taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Ayd\u0131n Security Directorate on suspicion of their membership to an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP/C.\n\nIn their police statements the applicants accepted the accusations against them.\n\nOn 22 August 1995 the applicants were brought before the investigating judge at the Ayd\u0131n Magistrate\u2019s Court, where they repeated the statements they had made to the police. The investigating judge ordered that they be placed in detention on remand.\n\nIn an indictment dated 6 September 1995, the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants. He charged the first applicant with being member of an armed gang under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and the second applicant with aiding and abetting an armed gang under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.\n\nDuring the hearings before the Izmir State Security Court, the applicants denied the statements they had made to the police and the investigating judge.\n\nOn 25 March 1997 the Izmir State Security Court, composed of two civilian judges and a military judge, convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced the first applicant to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment and the second applicant to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. Neither the applicants nor their lawyers were present in this last hearing.\n\nThe applicants appealed. On 12 November 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal, upholding the Izmir State Security Court\u2019s reasoning and assessment of evidence. The decision, which was pronounced in the absence of the applicants and their lawyers, was deposited with the Registry of the Izmir State Security Court on 21 November 1997."}

case originated in an application (no. 19582/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ali \u00c7imen (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 8 December 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. \u0130\u015feri, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 March 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicant during his police custody and the non-communication of the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Izmir.\n\nOn 17 April 2000 the applicant was taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of his involvement in the activities of an illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was interrogated at the Anti-Terrorist branch in the absence of a lawyer. According to a form explaining arrested persons\u2019 rights which the applicant had signed, he had been reminded of the charges against him and of his right to remain silent. In his statement, the applicant admitted to his involvement in the illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn 20 April 2000 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge at the Izmir State Security Court. Before the public prosecutor and the judge, again in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant admitted that he had participated in certain activities of the illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested to visit him; however this request was rejected by the Public Prosecutor.\n\nOn 2 May 2000 the Public Prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with that court, accusing the applicant of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. He requested that the applicant be sentenced and convicted under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).\n\nOn 5 December 2000 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment. In its decision, the court attached particular importance to the applicant\u2019s statements to the investigating judge.\n\nOn 25 December 2000 the applicant appealed. On an unspecified date, the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion. This opinion was not served on the applicant or his representative. On 11 June 2001, the Court of Cassation, upholding the reasoning and assessment of the Izmir State Security Court, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal."}

case originated in an application (no. 21377/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ahmet Kenan Er (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 April 2004. The applicant was represented by Mr H.\u0130. Er, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 18 November 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 10 October 1990 the applicant, who served as a first lieutenant in the Turkish Armed Forces at the material time, was arrested on suspicion of, inter alia, professional misconduct and bribery.\n\nOn 28 March 1991 the military prosecutor at the 33rd Infantry Division Commander's office filed an indictment charging the applicant with twenty-four different offences, including professional misconduct, bribery and assault and battery of his inferiors.\n\nOn 12 May 1993 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty of the remaining offences.\n\nOn 19 January 1994 the Military Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in relation to certain offences and quashed the remainder of the judgment on grounds of, inter alia, insufficient investigation.\n\nOn 7 November 1995 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty as charged for the remaining offences.\n\nOn 6 March 1996 the Military Court of Cassation partially upheld the first-instance court's judgment.\n\nOn 16 April 1996 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court once again acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty of the remaining offences.\n\nOn 9 May 1997 the applicant was expelled from the armed forces.\n\nOn 10 June 1998 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on procedural grounds in relation to certain charges and for being time-barred (zamana\u015f\u0131m\u0131) in relation to the remainder.\n\nOn 5 August 1999 the \u00c7orlu Military Court found the applicant guilty as charged in relation to those offences which were not time-barred and of which he had not already been acquitted.\n\nOn 28 March 2001 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court once again in the light of a recent amendment to the relevant jurisdictional rules, and held that the case should be heard by ordinary criminal courts.\n\nOn 26 December 2001 the \u00c7orlu Military Court issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction and referred the case to the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court.\n\nOn 2 December 2003 the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against the applicant as the prosecution had become time-barred."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 45288/99) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Jan Ci\u0105gadlak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 May 1998.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nOn 4 December 2001 the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nOn 2 April 1992 the applicant filed with the Warsaw Regional Court (s\u0105d wojew\u00f3dzki) a petition in which he requested the annulment of a judgment delivered in 1947 in criminal proceedings against him, submitting that they had been of a political nature. He also claimed compensation.\n\nOn 10 February 1993 the court annulled that judgment. However, its decision did not relate to the compensation claim.\n\nOn 19 February 1993 the applicant filed another compensation claim.\n\nSubsequently, he lodged several complaints concerning the inactivity of the court, but to no avail.\n\nIn her letters of 15 December 1993 and 29 June 1994, in reply to the applicant's complaints, a judge of the Regional Court informed the applicant that the delay in the examination of his compensation claim was caused by a large number of similar requests lodged with that court and the dearth of judges.\n\nOn 22 February 1995 the court held a hearing. A public prosecutor requested that the proceedings be stayed, submitting that a part of the Regional Court's decision of 10 February 1993 was invalid and required supplementation. Subsequently, the court stayed the proceedings.\n\nThe hearing scheduled for 22 March 1995 was adjourned at the applicant's request.\n\nOn 4 April 1995 the Regional Court asked the Office for the State Protection (Urz\u0105d Ochrony Pa\u0144stwa) to submit certain documents. The documents were submitted to the court on 27 March 1996.\n\nOn 4 July 1996 the proceedings were resumed.\n\nThe court adjourned the hearing scheduled for 23 January 1997, as the proceedings concerning the annulment of the criminal judgment against the applicant given in 1947 had not been completed.\n\nOn 19 June 2000 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment. It awarded the applicant PLN 7,500 in compensation. He did not lodge an appeal against that judgment."}

Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Ms Gra\u017cyna Walto\u015b and Ms Wanda Pawlicz (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 30 June 2006.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr M. Werner, a lawyer practising in Szczecin-Mierzyn. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 21 June 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1949 and 1956, respectively, and live in Koszalin.\n\nA. Civil proceedings for payment\n\nOn 1 August 1997 the applicants filed a claim with the Koszalin District Court against a housing co-operative concerning the amount of maintenance fees to be fixed in respect of their apartment building.\n\nOn 24 November 1998 the proceedings were stayed pending the termination of parallel proceedings relating to the alleged nullity of an amendment made to the co-operative\u2019s statute. The Koszalin District Court resumed the proceedings on 7 March 2003.\n\nOn 13 May 2003 a hearing was held. The court requested the Koszalin Regional Court to provide the case-file of the proceedings relating to the alleged nullity of an amendment made to the co-operative\u2019s statute.\n\nOn 16 June 2003 the Koszalin District Court decided to stay the proceedings at the applicants\u2019 request. They were resumed, upon the applicants\u2019 request, on 17 November 2004.\n\nHearings were subsequently held on 23 February, 11 August, 22 September, 10 November and 9 December 2005.\n\nOn 30 January 2006 the Koszalin District Court decided to admit an expert opinion. On 6 June and 16 August 2006 the expert requested prolongation of the time-limit for submission of the opinion.\n\nOn 6 September 2006 the court summoned the expert to submit the opinion within 7 days.\n\nIn 2007 the District Court held 7 hearings.\n\n18 October 2007 the Koszalin District Court gave a judgment in the case.\n\nThe judgment was quashed on 27 February 2009 by the Koszalin Regional Court and the case remitted for re-examination.\n\nThe proceedings are currently pending before the first-instance court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 30 November 2005 the applicants lodged a complaint under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d). On 6 January 2006 the Koszalin Regional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaint, finding that the trial court could not be held responsible for any delays and that the proceedings had been prolonged as it had been necessary to stay them."}

lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u0142owiecki (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 3 August 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms I. Korna\u015b-Pierzak, a lawyer practising in Cracow. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, inter alia, that the lustration proceedings in his case had been unfair, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 25 February 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Stronie \u015al\u0105skie.\n\nOn 3 August 1997 the Law of 11 April 1997 on disclosing work for or service in the State\u2019s security services or collaboration with them between 1944 and 1990 by persons exercising public functions (ustawa o ujawnieniu pracy lub s\u0142u\u017cby w organach bezpiecze\u0144stwa pa\u0144stwa lub wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy z nimi w latach 1944-1990 os\u00f3b pe\u0142ni\u0105cych funkcje publiczne) (the \u201c1997 Lustration Act\u201d) entered into force.\n\nOn 14 April 2004 the applicant, a candidate for the European Parliament, declared that he had not collaborated with the communist-era secret services. He was subsequently elected as a Member of the European Parliament.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) decided to institute lustration proceedings against the applicant following a request made by the Commissioner of the Public Interest (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego) on the grounds that the applicant had lied in his lustration declaration by denying that he had cooperated with the secret services.\n\nOn 17 February 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the first\u2011instance lustration court, found that the applicant had submitted an untrue lustration declaration since he had been an intentional and secret collaborator with the State\u2019s secret services. The court established that the applicant had met on probably two occasions in 1973 with agents of the secret services and had agreed to help them as a consultant.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision. He submitted that he had never collaborated with the secret services and the meeting in question had been in connection with the preparation of an article. The applicant also referred to his subsequent activity in the \u201cSolidarno\u015b\u0107\u201d movement for which he had been persecuted and detained by the communist authorities. Subsequently, he was allowed to leave Poland and between 1985 and 1994 he was a deputy of the Polish Section of Radio Free Europe in Munich.\n\nOn 6 June 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the second\u2011instance lustration court, upheld the impugned judgment.\n\nOn 1 February 2007 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal. That decision was notified to the applicant on 8 March 2007."}

Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr January Jagie\u0142\u0142o (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 August 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government.\n\nApplying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nOn 28 November 1995, the applicant, who is a taxi driver by profession, was involved in a traffic accident.\n\nOn 28 February 1996 the applicant was charged with causing the accident. On 2 September 1997 the applicant was served with a bill of indictment.\n\nThe hearing set for 16 March 1998 was adjourned due to the presiding judge\u2019s illness. On 11 July 2001 the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) held the first hearing in the case. The hearing set for 20 September 2001 was adjourned due to the witnesses\u2019 absence.\n\nOn 7 December 2001 the court ordered an expert opinion to be obtained. On 30 April 2002 the expert submitted his opinion to the court. The court ordered a supplementary opinion to be obtained.\n\nThe hearing set for 18 September 2002 was adjourned. At the hearing held on 7 November 2002 the Warsaw District Court gave judgment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 6 June 2003 the Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) quashed the first\u2011instance judgment and remitted the case.\n\nFollowing the remittal, on 23 September 2004 the Warsaw District Court gave judgment. The court sentenced the applicant to one year imprisonment stayed for two years. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe applicant filed a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (\u201c2004 Act\u201d). On 16 November 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court gave a decision and confirmed that the proceedings had indeed been lengthy. However, the court did not grant any compensation to the applicant.\n\nOn 29 April 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court held an appeal hearing and gave judgment. The judgment is final.\n\nOn 6 June 2005 the applicant again filed a complaint with the Supreme Court under the 2004 Act alleging that a copy of the final judgment had not yet been served on him. The Supreme Court rejected the complaint, on a later unknown date, as the applicant had never asked to be served with a copy of the final judgment.\n\nOn 21 February 2006 the applicant for the third time filed a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under the 2004 Act. On 29 September 2006 the court refused to deal with the merits of the complaint. The court held that the proceedings had already been terminated and therefore the complaint was groundless."}

originated in an application (no. 63131/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Leszek G\u0119bura (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 12 May 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that a delay in releasing him from prison had given rise to a violation of Article 5.\n\nOn 17 March 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Starachowice.\n\nThe applicant was serving a prison sentence in Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison following three separate convictions. The overall term of his imprisonment was due to come to an end on 6 January 2002.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code applicable to re-offenders, the applicant became eligible for conditional release after having served three-quarters of the overall term of his imprisonment, namely on 6 January 1999. After that date, the applicant requested a court on several occasions to grant him conditional release. However, his requests were denied on grounds of insufficient progress in his rehabilitation. On 20 March 2000 the prison governor requested the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) to order the applicant's release (warunkowe przedterminowe zwolnienie) in view of his satisfactory rehabilitation. The Tarn\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor objected to that request.\n\nOn 22 March 2000 the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court gave a decision ordering the applicant's conditional release for a three-year probationary period. It placed the applicant under the court officer's supervision and imposed certain other obligations on him.\n\nThe Tarn\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor appealed against that decision. The Regional Court did not amend its decision and transmitted the prosecutor's appeal to the Cracow Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny).\n\nThe hearing before the Court of Appeal was scheduled for 12 April 2000 at 8.45 a.m. On that day the Cracow Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Regional Court. No further appeal lay against the decision of the Court of Appeal. In the applicant's submission, the Court of Appeal's decision was delivered at 9 a.m.\n\nLater on 12 April 2000, a certified copy of the Court of Appeal's decision was sent to the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court, which received it on 13 April 2000. On the same day the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court ordered the governor of the Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison to release the applicant and served him with a copy of the Court of Appeal's decision. The governor received these documents on 14 April 2000.\n\nAccording to the official release certificate, the applicant was released on 14 April 2000.

(no. 47328/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Nurettin \u015eirin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 15 March 1999.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Arani, a lawyer practising in Middlesex (United Kingdom). The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 27 April 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal and the failure to notify the applicant of the public prosecutor\u2019s submissions on his appeal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1964, resides in Istanbul.\n\nOn 31 January 1997 the applicant made a speech about the liberation movement in Palestine and praised the Muslim leaders who worked for the liberation of Jerusalem during a meeting which was organised by the Sincan District Council in Ankara.\n\nOn 6 February 1997 the applicant was taken into police custody. In his statement, he explained that he supported the Iranian regime and that he longed for a regime that was based on the Koran.\n\nOn 13 February 1997 the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court. During his questioning by the prosecutor, the applicant repeated his police statement. On the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge attached to the Ankara State Security Court and he was subsequently placed in detention on remand.\n\nIn an indictment dated 7 March 1997, the Ankara State Security Court public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant.\n\nBefore the Ankara State Security Court, which was composed of three judges including a military judge, the applicant contested the charges against him.\n\nOn 15 October 1997 the Ankara State Security Court convicted the applicant of being a member of an illegal organisation and sentenced him to seventeen years and six months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to Article 168 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 6 January 1998 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. The Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion on the merits of the appeal. The opinion was not notified to the applicant, but was read out during the hearing before the Court of Cassation.\n\nOn 21 September 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, upholding the Ankara State Security Court\u2019s assessment of evidence and its reasons for rejecting the applicant\u2019s defence.\n\nOn 24 December 1998 the Chief Public Prosecutor attached to the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant\u2019s request for rectification."}

10262/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Turgut K\u00f6kl\u00fc (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 17 February 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs S. Akat, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 September 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 10 March 1998 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, namely the TIKB (the Revolutionary Communist Union of Turkey).\n\nOn 13 March 1998 he was brought before the public prosecutor and then the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court. The latter remanded him in custody on the same day.\n\nOn 17 March 1998 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Istanbul State Security Court, charging the applicant with membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code.\n\nBetween 25 March 1998 and 21 March 2001, the court held nineteen hearings. During these hearings the Istanbul Security Court, relying on the state of the evidence, the nature of the offence, and the duration of his detention, refused to release the applicant.\n\nOn 21 March 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court pronounced its judgment and convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment under Article 168 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 8 August 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed this judgment. The case was accordingly remitted to the Istanbul State Security Court.\n\nOn 17 September 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court resumed the trial. During the subsequent hearings, the court rejected the applicant\u2019s requests for release, having regard to the state of the evidence.\n\nAt the hearing on 1 June 2003, the applicant\u2019s lawyer once again requested the court to release the applicant. In her submissions, she also drew attention to the psychological state and treatment of the applicant. The court rejected this request. An appeal lodged in that connection was also dismissed by a further court on 28 August 2003.\n\nBy Law no. 5190, in June 2004 State Security Courts were abolished. Subsequently, the Istanbul Assize Court acquired jurisdiction over the case.\n\nOn 25 October 2004 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested the court to release the applicant. On 1 November 2004 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nAccording to the information made available to the Court by the parties to date, the case is apparently still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court."}

under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by twelve Turkish nationals, Mr Resul Sadak, Mr Nihat Osal, Mr Mehmet \u00c7akar, Mr Rustem Bayar, Mr Tahir Kutlu, Mr Cengiz Bal\u0131k, Mr \u0130zzet Belge, Mr Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mr Mehmet Temelkuran, Mr Mehmet Nezir Ayan, Mr Yakup Uyar and Mr Erdal G\u00fcler (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 1 April 2001.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr T. El\u00e7i, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 3 November 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the applicants\u2019 right to be brought promptly before a judge. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nAt the time of the events giving rise to the application, Mr Resul Sadak was the provincial leader and the other applicants were members of the Peoples\u2019 Democracy Party (Halk\u0131n Demokrasi Partisi, hereinafter \u201cHADEP\u201d) in \u015e\u0131rnak, which was a province in the State of Emergency region.\n\nOn 23 September 2000 Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Yakup Uyar went to Batman in order to participate in the Batman Provincial Congress of HADEP in two cars belonging to Yakup Uyar and Erdal G\u00fcler. On their way back to \u015e\u0131rnak from Batman, they were stopped in D\u00fczova village, in Cizre, and arrested by gendarmerie officers. The applicants were then taken to the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial gendarmerie command.\n\nOn 27 September 2000 at 2 p.m. Erdal G\u00fcler was taken into custody. He was kept in custody until 11 a.m. on 1 October 2000.\n\nOn 1 October 2000 the applicants were brought before the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor and the \u015e\u0131rnak Magistrates\u2019 Court (sulh ceza mahkemesi). On the same day, the \u015e\u0131rnak Magistrates\u2019 Court ordered that Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Erdal G\u00fcler be detained on remand and that Yakup Uyar be released.\n\nSubsequently, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicants on charges of aiding and abetting the PKK contrary to Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713, and illegal possession of firearms and explosives contrary to Article 264 \u00a7 5 of the Criminal Code and Article 13 \u00a7 2 of Law no. 6136.\n\nOn 12 December 2000 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court ordered the applicants\u2019 release pending trial.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003 the applicants were acquitted of the charges against them."}

originated in an application (no. 38414/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Umut Taner (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 2 October 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K. Bilgi\u00e7, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he did not receive a fair and public hearing, as he was not informed promptly of the accusation against him, he did not have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and that he was not allowed to defend himself in person or through a lawyer.\n\nOn 13 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nOn 30 May 2006 the Government filed observations on the admissibility and merits. On 19 October 2006 the President of the Third Section refused to include in the case file the applicant's observations in reply to Government's observations and his just satisfaction claims which were filed outside the time-limit (Rule 38 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1984 and lives in \u0130zmir.\n\nOn 26 June 2002 the applicant, together with a friend of his, quarrelled with a man in a park. The quarrel had turned into a fight and the applicant stabbed the man in his left leg. The police and the public prosecutor took the statements of the parties, including the applicant. The applicant denied having injured the man. Following their questioning, they were all released.\n\nOn 3 July 2002 the Public Prosecutor at the \u0130zmir Magistrates' Court filed an indictment against the applicant, on account of assault with a knife and occasioning actual bodily harm. The indictment was not notified to the applicant.\n\nAfter having examined the case file, on 17 July 2002 the \u0130zmir Magistrates' Court issued a penal order, convicting the applicant and sentencing him to pay 290,805,465 Turkish liras (TRL).\n\nOn 30 August 2002 the penal order was notified to the applicant.\n\nOn 6 September 2002 the applicant challenged the decision of the \u0130zmir Magistrate's Court, before the \u0130zmir Criminal Court of First Instance. He argued that he had been deprived of his right of defence in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 11 September 2002 the \u0130zmir Criminal Court of First Instance upheld the decision of the Magistrate's Court, maintaining that it was in accordance with the law and procedure.\n\nOn 25 September 2002 the \u0130zmir Public Prosecutor issued a payment order under which the applicant was obliged to pay the relevant amount. He was warned that in case he failed to pay the due amount, the fine would be converted into prison sentence.\n\nThe applicant paid the relevant charge on 26 November 2002."}

Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Zbigniew Radaj, (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 February 1994 and 4 October 1996 respectively.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Krzysztof Drzewicki of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his correspondence with the Convention organs was, while he was detained on remand, twice intercepted, opened and read by the prison authorities and by the court before which the criminal proceedings against him were pending.\n\nThe applications were transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe applications were allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1. On 14 October 1999 the Court decided to join the applications.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.\n\nBy a decision of 21 March 2002 the Court declared the applications partly admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a Polish national, who was born in 1953 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nTwo letters from the Secretariat of the European Commission of Human Rights, posted on 20 March 1996 and on 14 May 1996, were intercepted, opened and read by the administration of the Warszawa-S\u0142u\u017cewiec prison, where the applicant was detained on remand. They were subsequently forwarded to the Warsaw District Court, before which criminal proceedings against the applicant were pending at that time, and were read by the court.\n\nOn 29 April 1996 the applicant requested the President of the Warsaw District Court to explain what was the legal basis on which his correspondence with the European Commission of Human Rights had been opened and read.\n\nHe reiterated his complaint on 31 July 1996 in a letter to the President of the Regional Court. In reply, on 15 October 1996 the President of the Regional Court informed him that Article 8 of the Convention did not prohibit censorship of correspondence of persons detained on remand. It was also permitted under Section 33 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Detention on Remand. The correspondence sent to the European Commission of Human Rights fell within the scope of this provision. It was further stated that the text of the Convention did not contain provisions relating to the inviolability of the correspondence to and from the European Commission of Human Rights."}

Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Piotr Osuch (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 July 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 18 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the excessive length of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nOn 10 March 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery and extortion. He was also suspected of being a member of an organised criminal group.\n\nOn 12 March 1999 the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be detained until 9 June 1999. The court found that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question.\n\nOn 1 June 1999 the District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention. It referred to the interests of the pending investigation, such as the need to obtain additional evidence. The court also considered that the applicant, if released, could induce witnesses to give false testimony.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged several times by the District Court for the same reasons as before.\n\nOn 27 August 1999 the Warsaw Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okr\u0119gowy) lodged with the Warsaw District Court a bill of indictment against the applicant and six other persons. They were indicted of several counts of robbery, extortion, and membership of an organised criminal group.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently extended by the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) on 6 March, 26 June, 28 September and 30 November 2001. The court considered that keeping the applicant in custody was justified by the existence of strong evidence against him and the gravity of the charges. It was also necessary as he could obstruct the proper course of the proceedings or induce witnesses to give false testimony. The applicant\u2019s appeals against those decisions were dismissed.\n\nOn 16 January 2002 the Warsaw District Court convicted the applicant of several counts of robbery and extortion committed in an organised criminal group. The applicant was sentenced to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) upheld the first-instance judgment on 6 February 2003.\n\nOn 28 October 2003 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal."}

34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Etem Karag\u00f6z (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 18 August 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. G\u00fczel, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 27 June 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29\u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nOn 19 January 1994 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody by officers of the Diyarbak\u0131r security police in connection with an investigation into an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 7 February 1994 the applicant was brought before the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor and then the investigating judge, who remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nBy an indictment dated 17 March 1994, the public prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and a number of others, accusing him, inter alia, of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory under Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 30 July 1997 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court convicted and sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment, pursuant to Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 1 March 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on procedural grounds and remitted the case to the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court. Following constitutional amendments introduced on 7 May 2004, the State Security Courts were totally abolished. Subsequently, the applicant\u2019s case was resumed before the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nThroughout the whole proceedings the applicant regularly requested his release whereas the trial courts rejected his requests. On 20 October 2005 the applicant noted that he had already been detained for a period of more than eleven years and reiterated his request. Relying on the accusations against the applicant, the existence of strong evidence against him and the content of the case file, the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r refused his request again. The applicant appealed. On 25 October 2005 the 4th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r dismissed the appeal without further reasoning.\n\nOn 9 March 2007 the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r convicted the applicant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On 7 March 2008 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment."}

the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Seydo Kalg\u0131 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 September 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. G\u00fczeler, a lawyer practising in \u015eanl\u0131urfa. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 7 July 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1938 and lives in \u015eanl\u0131urfa.\n\nIn the cadastral survey carried out in 1964 some plots of land in Siverek village were registered in the names of the applicant and a number of other individuals. In 1971 an individual further donated his share of a plot in the same village to the applicant.\n\nOn 28 August 1972 two villagers (O.T., H.Y.) instituted civil proceedings against another villager (M.E.) objecting to the cadastral registrations and claiming that they were the lawful owners of the land in question on the basis of a registration dating from before 1950. It appears that on unspecified dates during the course of the proceedings numerous villagers, including the applicant, became parties to the proceedings, which continued with three complainants, seventeen defendants and two intervening third parties. Both the claimants and defendants claimed to have title to the land in question.\n\nOn 9 June 1983 the trial court requested the applicant's address to be determined so that he could be summoned before the court. On 20 March 1985 the trial court decided to publish the summons in a country-wide newspaper in an attempt to determine the applicant's whereabouts.\n\nOn 18 November 1985 H.Y. submitted a letter to the trial court informing the judge of an agreement he had reached with the applicant and stating that the applicant would appear before the court to testify accordingly.\n\nThe case file indicates that the applicant did not appear before the trial court until 22 March 2004, when he presented himself as one of the parties. On 22 November 2004 the applicant's representative submitted a power of attorney to the trial court.\n\nDuring the course of the proceedings the court held an on-site inspection on 23 June 1986. A number of expert reports were requested concerning the title registrations. Numerous witnesses were heard on various occasions. Some of the defendants transferred part of their shares to others on different dates.\n\nOn 5 March 2007 the Siverek Cadastral Court delivered its judgment in favour of the applicant and the other defendants. It appears that the number of claimants and defendants had reached twenty-eight and eighty-one respectively by the time the judgment was delivered.\n\nThe case is still pending before the Court of Cassation."}

originated in an application (no. 39712/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Janusz Dudek (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 October 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 14 January 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Cz\u0119stochowa.\n\nOn 23 October 2003 the applicant, who is a police officer, was charged with abuse of powers.\n\nOn 4 November 2003 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 5 November 2003 the applicant was released. The Krak\u00f3w Appeal Prosecutor (Prokuratura Apelacyjna) suspended the applicant from professional duties and ordered that he be subjected to police supervision in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It further referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nOn 20 November 2003 the applicant lodged an application with the prosecutor, requesting access to the investigation file. On 28 November 2003 the prosecutor dismissed the application. He referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nIn the meantime, on 22 November 2003, the applicant had lodged an application for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. The application was dismissed by the Prosecutor of Appeal. In his decision the prosecutor referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation and the seriousness of the offences the applicant was charged with.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, on 4 March and 2 June 2004, 14 March 2005 and 28 April 2006, the applicant made unsuccessful applications for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure and he appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against decisions dismissing his applications. In his applications he referred to the poor financial situation of his family resulting from the lengthy application of the preventive measure.\n\nOn 4 April 2006 the Krak\u00f3w Appeal Prosecutor decided to obtain a psychiatric report on the applicant and his ability to stand trial.\n\nOn 3 September 2007 the applicant lodged an application for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. On 2 October 2007 the Krak\u00f3w Prosecutor of Appeal lifted the preventive measure.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the proceedings were severed on several occasions and of the 110 suspects in this case 75 were indicted. However, the investigation concerning the remaining suspects, including the applicant, has not yet been completed."}

applicant\u201d), on 1 October 2004.\n\nBy a letter of 11 March 2007, the Registry was informed of the death of the applicant. His parents, Mrs Muhteber \u00dctebay and Mr \u0130yasettin \u00dctebay, and his brother, Mr Ercan \u00dctebay, declared their intention to pursue the application.\n\nFor practical reasons, Mr \u00dctebay will continue to be called \u201cthe applicant\u201d in this judgment, although his family is now to be regarded as such (see Ahmet Sad\u0131k v. Greece, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011V, p. 1641, \u00a7 3).\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr F. Babao\u011flu, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 November 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lived in \u0130stanbul. He died on 14 June 2005.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nOn 7 March 1994 the applicant was taken into police custody in Mu\u015f on suspicion of being a member of the illegal PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). On 13 March 1994 he was handed over to the Istanbul Security Directorate for further investigation.\n\nOn 21 March 1994 the applicant was taken before the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who ordered his detention pending trial.\n\nBy an indictment dated 23 June 1994, the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and forty-five other defendants before the Istanbul State Security Court, accusing them, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of involvement in activities that undermined the constitutional order of the State. The prosecution requested that the applicant be sentenced pursuant to Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 5 May 1999 the Istanbul State Security Court, composed of three judges including a military judge, decided that the applicant's case should be separated from the file as his final defence submissions had not been submitted to the court.\n\nOn 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judge sitting on the bench of the Istanbul State Security Court was replaced by a civilian judge.\n\nThe case against the applicant continued before the Istanbul State Security Court. In the course of the proceedings the State Security Court rejected the applicant's requests for release, taking into account the nature of the alleged offence and the state of the evidence.\n\nOn 5 April 2004 the applicant was released pending trial. The case was still pending before the domestic courts when the applicant died on 14 June 2005."}

case originated in an application (no. 62324/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Wojciech Depa (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 26 May 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 December 2005 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.\n\nOn 14 January 1998 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 16 January 1998 the Krak\u00f3w District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed offences of kidnapping, sequestration, attempted murder and theft. The court established that there was a risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence as he had attempted to intimidate the victim and that he might abscond since two other alleged perpetrators had gone into hiding.\n\nBetween 27 March and 11 August 1998 the applicant served a prison sentence ordered in another set of criminal proceedings.\n\nOn 6 April 1998 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and on the need to continue the investigation, in particular so that he could undergo a psychiatric examination.\n\nOn 14 July and 27 October 1998 the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was further prolonged. The latter decision was taken at a public hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The court found that keeping the applicant in custody was justified by the strong suspicion that he had committed the offences, the probability that a severe sentence would be imposed and the fact that the third alleged perpetrator was still in hiding.\n\nThe applicant appealed against those decisions arguing that there was no evidence that once released he would obstruct the proper course of the proceedings or abscond. The applicant further asked the court to take into consideration his difficult family situation as his parents needed his support.\n\nIn the meantime, on 13 July 1998, the applicant was indicted before the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy).\n\nAt a hearing held on 16 February 1999, at which the applicant was present, the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention. The court found: \u201cThe fact that [the applicant] has been charged with having committed attempted murder is a sufficient ground for imposing the most severe preventive measure, that is detention on remand.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, on 14 May and 16 August 1999, the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was prolonged by the trial court. The first decision was taken at a public hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The court relied on the strong probability that the applicant had committed the offences and the advanced stage of the trial.\n\nOn several occasions the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests to attend the court\u2019s session at which his appeals against the decisions to prolong his pre-trial detention were examined. The court established that the presence of the applicant was not necessary as he was represented by two lawyers of his choice who could attend the court\u2019s session.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s numerous applications for release and appeals against the decisions to prolong the detention were to no avail.\n\nIn 1999 the trial court held in total thirteen hearings.\n\nOn 10 January 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court gave a judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal. On 13 April 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case. The court further decided to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention on remand. His lawyers were present at the hearing.\n\nOn 27 July 2000 the trial court held the first hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The Regional Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention justifying it with reference to the reasonable suspicion that he had committed offences in question and the severity of the anticipated penalty. The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that his detention was contrary to international treaties, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nOn 24 August 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s request to attend the session at which his appeal against the decision of 27 July 2000 was to be examined, on the grounds that his presence was neither obligatory nor necessary. On the same date the court dismissed the appeal. It also dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests to release him from detention and to apply another preventive measure instead, such as bail. The Court found that his family\u2019s situation was not as difficult as the applicant had indicated. It further established that the severity of the anticipated penalty was a sufficient ground (\u201csamodzielna przes\u0142anka\u201d) for his continued detention and was consistent with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Nevertheless, the court decided to limit the period for which the detention was to be prolonged to 31 January 2001. The applicant\u2019s lawyer was present at the session.\n\nAfterwards, the applicant\u2019s detention was further prolonged at public hearings held on 22 November 2000 and 20 April, 13 June, 27 September and 13 December 2001. The applicant and his lawyers were present at these hearings. In the meantime, the court held a session on 23 February 2001 at which it prolonged the detention. One of the applicant\u2019s lawyer was present. It appears that on each occasion the Regional Court repeated the grounds for detention given previously: the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and the severity of the penalty that might be imposed. The court further dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests for release and found that the situation of his parents and his state of health were undoubtedly difficult but not \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. The decisions were upheld on appeal by the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s numerous requests for release were to no avail. His applications and appeals against the decisions to prolong his detention were dismissed at court sessions. The applicant\u2019s lawyers were present at most of those sessions.\n\nOn 6 February 2002 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment.\n\nOn 19 September 2002 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal partly allowed the appeal. The applicant was acquitted of the charge of attempted murder and his sentence was reduced to five years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant\u2019s court-appointed lawyer lodged on his behalf a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy). On 3 June 2003 the Supreme Court partly allowed the cassation appeal, quashed the appeal court\u2019s judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 24 June 2004 the Krakow Court of Appeal gave a judgment. The court amended its judgment of 19 September 2002 but it upheld the applicant\u2019s sentence. The judgment became final."}

originated in an application (no. 11375/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a German national, Mr Anton Kaleta (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 1 June 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The German Government did not make use of their right to intervene (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his daughter, which had violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention\n\nOn 12 July 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Taufkirchen, Germany.\n\nThe applicant and W.K. had a daughter M., born on 11 June 1989. The couple married in August 1989. The applicant and his wife separated on 1 August 1992.\n\nOn 3 September 1992 W.K lodged a divorce petition with the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki). On 9 February 1993 the proceedings were discontinued as she had withdrawn her petition.\n\nIn 1993 W.K. again lodged a petition for divorce, this time with the Family Court in Munich.\n\nBetween 23 February 1994 and 3 August 1994 W.K. was detained on charges of child abduction and theft. On 3 August 1994 she was acquitted by the Munich Court.\n\nOn 27 February 1995 the Munich District Court awarded custody rights to W.K. The court considered that the mother took great care of the child and that the child had very good living conditions at her mother\u2019s place.\n\nOn 15 June 1994 the applicant lodged an application with the B\u0119dzin District Court for sole custody of his daughter.\n\nOn 22 June 1995 the District Court in B\u0119dzin, Poland, gave a decision. The court awarded parental rights to W.K and limited the applicant\u2019s rights to visiting rights. The court did not specify the access arrangements. The court also restricted W.K.\u2019s parental rights by appointing a guardian to supervise her in the exercise of her rights.\n\nMeanwhile, on 9 December 1994 the applicant asked the court to specify the access arrangements.\n\nOn 5 October 1995 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Convention. It allowed the applicant to visit the child on the first Friday of each month between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. The meeting was to take place on the premises of the B\u0119dzin Family Centre (O\u015brodek pomocy dziecku i rodzinie w B\u0119dzinie). In addition, W.K and a court guardian were to be present during the meeting.\n\nOn 14 November 1996 the Bedzin Family Centre confirmed that between October 1995 and 14 November 1996 the applicant failed to report for visits. On the other hand, the child and the mother were present at every meeting.\n\nOn 20 November 1996 the applicant applied to the B\u0119dzin District Court to change the access arrangements. He wished to see his daughter during ten days of the winter holidays and two weeks in summer. On 27 November 1997 the B\u0119dzin District Court dismissed his request.\n\nOn 25 November 1996 the applicant lodged an application with the Munich District Court challenging his paternity with respect to M.K. However, a DNA test confirmed his paternity.\n\nOn 15 August 1997 the Family Court in Munich dissolved the applicant\u2019s marriage and awarded parental rights to W.K.\n\nOn 5 January 1998 W.K. instituted proceedings before the B\u0119dzin District Court in which she requested that the applicant be divested of his parental rights on the ground that he had been aggressive towards her. She further requested that the court prohibit the applicant from having contact with his daughter.\n\nOn 20 October 1998 the applicant asked the court to dismiss W.K.\u2019s request. He also requested that it grant him parental authority and limit W.K.\u2019s parental authority to a right to have contact with the child. He submitted that W.K. was incapable of bringing up a child and had a history of criminal convictions for theft. In addition, criminal proceedings against her were pending (for assault on the applicant).\n\nOn 9 March 2000 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision and dismissed both the applicant\u2019s and his ex-wife\u2019s requests. It also varied the contact arrangement of 1995. The court allowed the applicant to visit his daughter three times a year, on the first Friday of every fourth month between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. The court held that the meeting was to take place on the premises of the B\u0119dzin Family Centre and W.K. and a court guardian were to be present during the meetings.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 7 June 2000 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed his appeal. The court repeated the reasons given by the District Court.\n\nOn 20 June 2000 the Katowice District Court convicted W.K. of assault on the applicant.\n\nA further cassation appeal by the applicant was dismissed by the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) on 12 December 2000. The court referred to the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001 W.K. failed to report with the child to the B\u0119dzin Family Centre for visits. In particular, on 7 January, 5 May, and 1 September 2000, and 5 January and 4 May 2001 the applicant was present at the B\u0119dzin Family Centre. On all these occasions the mother did not bring the child.\n\nThe applicant met his daughter on 7 September 2001, 4 January, 4 May and 10 May 2002.\n\nOn October 2001 the applicant made a request for modification of his contact arrangements. He asked to see his daughter without the presence of the mother and the guardian. On 22 May 2002 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision. On the basis of an expert\u2019s report the court considered that contact with the applicant had been very stressful for the child. For these reasons and in view of the well-being of the child the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request.\n\nOn 11 October 2001 the applicant made a request to the Family Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court under Article 1050 of the Code, asking the court to fine W.K. for failure to comply with the order of 9 March 2000. On 5 June 2002 the court dismissed his request.\n\nOn 20 October 2003 the applicant met his daughter in the B\u0119dzin Family Centre.\n\nIn August 2004 the applicant\u2019s daughter (then fifteen years old) sent a letter to her father stating that she did not wish to see him.\n\nOn 3 September 2004 the mother again failed to bring M. for a visit.\n\nOn 15 December 2004 the applicant made a request to the Family Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court under Article 1050 of the Code, asking the court to fine W.K. for failure to comply with the order of 9 March 2000. He also asked the court to vary the contact arrangements and to allow him to visit his daughter three times a year, on the first Friday of every fourth month between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\nOn an unknown date the request to impose a fine on W.K. was transferred to the Civil Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court. On 20 October 2005 she was fined (1,000 Polish zlotys (PLN)) for failing to appear at meetings. Her appeal against his decision was dismissed on 15 February 2006.\n\nOn 7 January 2005 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision and dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for modification of the contact arrangements. The court heard the sixteen -year-old M., who stated that she did not wish to have any contact with the applicant. The court held that it was not in the child\u2019s best interest to vary the visiting arrangements."}

Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Adnan Levent \u00c7amlar (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 August 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Cang\u0131, a lawyer practising in \u0130zmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 24 June 2013 the complaints under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d) of the Convention concerning the independence and impartiality of the \u0130zmir State Security Court and the applicant\u2019s inability to examine or have examined witnesses were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and lives in London.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant in the United Kingdom\n\nOn 29 April 1997 the applicant was arrested in London on suspicion of trafficking of illegal drugs.\n\nOn the same day he was placed in police custody, where he was informed that he would be charged with importation of a controlled drug, namely diamorphine.\n\nIn his statements before the British police, the applicant maintained that he had been importing clothing goods from Turkey and had not been aware of the trafficking of drugs by his partners.\n\nOn 15 September 1998, after having heard witness statements and evaluated all relevant evidence, the Crown Court acquitted the applicant of all charges and ordered his release.\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant in Turkey\n\nOn 16 June 1997 the public prosecutor at the \u0130zmir State Security Court filed an indictment with that court, accusing certain persons of trafficking of illegal drugs by establishing a criminal organisation pursuant to Article 403 of the former Criminal Code (Law no. 765). In that indictment, the public prosecutor indicated the involvement of the applicant in the alleged acts, without bringing any charges against him.\n\nOn 19 August 1997 the public prosecutor issued an indictment, accusing the applicant of the same offence as the others. The public prosecutor stated that the applicant had actively participated in the transfer of the illegal drugs from Turkey to the United Kingdom and noted that he was in detention on remand in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn a report dated 13 June 1997, the public prosecutor stated that the British authorities had provided him with the tapes of the applicant\u2019s police statements as well as other evidence on the alleged offence.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 1997, the Magistrates\u2019 Court ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on remand in absentia.\n\nAt a hearing on 24 February 1998 the \u0130zmir State Security Court joined the proceedings against the applicant with the proceedings against the other persons involved in the same offence. At this hearing the domestic court also requested the case file of another set of related proceedings, which contained the statements of a certain F.A.\n\nOn 5 November 1998 one of the co-accused, B.\u04e6., gave his statements before the court, maintaining that he had been hired by the applicant for the receipt and storage of certain goods which he had not known to be drugs.\n\nOn 3 December 1998 the lawyer of one of the co-accused submitted to the national court the applicant\u2019s certificate of acquittal issued by the Crown Court.\n\nOn 15 July 1999 the military judge sitting on the \u0130zmir State Security Court hearing the applicant\u2019s case was replaced by a civilian judge.\n\nOn 20 September 1999 the applicant went back to Turkey; he was placed in detention on remand the following day.\n\nAt the subsequent hearing on 30 September 1999, the applicant submitted his statements before the court and denied his involvement in the trafficking of illegal drugs. In particular, he contested the incriminating statements of B.\u04e6. and F.A. The applicant further requested to have certain witnesses, including his counsel in the United Kingdom, heard. The \u0130zmir State Security Court rejected that request, finding that the statements of the witnesses called by the applicant would not contribute to the case in view of the information already available concerning the proceedings in the United Kingdom. The court went on to decide that the applicant should be released pending trial.\n\nDuring the numerous hearings which followed, the court deferred the examination of the case to the subsequent hearings, awaiting information as regards certain accused in the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the hearing on 18 February 2003, the public prosecutor submitted his written opinion, requesting that the accused be found guilty as charged, mainly on the basis of the investigation conducted in the United Kingdom and the evidence obtained during another set of proceedings concerning the same offence.\n\nOn 21 March 2003 the applicant submitted his written defence to the court and requested his acquittal. He argued that he could not be found guilty on the basis of evidence which according to the British court was insufficient to prove his involvement in the alleged acts.\n\nOn 27 March 2003, on the basis of the investigation conducted by the British authorities, the statements of B.\u04e6. and those made by F.A., which had been taken in another set of proceedings, the \u0130zmir State Security Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twenty four years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine.\n\nOn 31 March 2003 the applicant appealed against that judgment. During the appeal proceedings before the Court of Cassation the applicant submitted that the first instance court had based his conviction on evidence which he could not challenge, in particular the statements made in his absence by B.\u04e6. and F.A.\n\nOn 4 March 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the \u0130zmir State Security Court. The higher court indicated that the offence at issue concerned the exportation of illegal drugs and accordingly the case differed from that concluded in the United Kingdom. The high court dismissed the applicant\u2019s remaining grounds for appeal without further elaboration.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant went to the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), in June 2005, the applicant requested the reassessment of his case and the application of the more favourable clauses in the new Code.\n\nOn 16 December 2005, after having examined the case file, the \u0130zmir Assize Court reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment and decreased the amount of the fine.\n\nOn 28 June 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment, stating that the first-instance court was to hold a hearing.\n\nFollowing several hearings, which the applicant had not attended as he had not returned to Turkey, on 3 July 2008 the \u0130zmir Assize Court sentenced the applicant to twenty years and ten months of imprisonment and a fine pursuant to Article 188 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 5237).\n\nFollowing the applicant\u2019s appeal, on 9 April 2009 the Court of Cassation held a hearing and heard the submissions of the applicant\u2019s lawyer. Finally, the higher court upheld the judgment of the \u0130zmir Assize Court with a minor procedural correction."}

Spain lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Spanish national, Mr Antonio Aldeguer Tom\u00e1s (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 22 June 2009.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr M. R\u00f3denas P\u00e9rez, a lawyer practising in Madrid. The Spanish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr F. Sanz Gand\u00e1segui, State Attorney.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 that he had been discriminated against on the ground of his sexual orientation in that he had been denied a survivor\u2019s pension following the death of his partner, with whom he had lived in a de facto marital relationship for twelve years. In substance the applicant also relied on Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n\nOn 18 October 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nJudge Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra, the judge elected in respect of Spain, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). On 11 February 2015, the President of the Section accordingly appointed Ms Blanca Lozano Cutanda to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 26 \u00a7 4 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n (Madrid).\n\nThe applicant cohabited with another man in a homosexual relationship from 1990 until the latter\u2019s death on 2 July 2002. During that period they lived together in an apartment belonging to the applicant\u2019s partner. When his partner died, the sister and only heir of the applicant\u2019s partner gave the applicant, because of the relationship he had had with her brother, an apartment that had belonged to the applicant\u2019s late partner and in which the couple had spent their holidays together since 1990.\n\nOn 19 September 2003 the applicant claimed social security allowances as a surviving spouse, under section 174 (1) of the General Social Security Act, arguing that he had cohabited with his deceased partner for many years.\n\nOn 22 September 2003 the National Institute of Social Security (Instituto Nacional de la Seguridad Social, hereafter referred to as \u201cINSS\u201d) refused to grant the applicant a survivor\u2019s pension on the ground that since he had not been married to the deceased person, he could not legally be considered as his surviving spouse for the purposes of section 174 (1) of the General Social Security Act. That decision was formally served on 13 June 2005.\n\nOn 1 July 2005 Law no. 13/2005 amending the provisions of the Civil Code with respect to the right to enter into marriage was passed. Two days later it entered into force. This law legalised same-sex marriage in Spain. In accordance with its first additional provision all legal and regulatory provisions making reference to marriage should be understood thereafter as applicable to all marriages irrespective of the sex of its members (see paragraph 35 below).\n\nOn 5 July 2005 the applicant filed an administrative complaint against the decision of 22 September 2003. This complaint was dismissed by the INSS on 11 August 2005. The INSS noted that there was no provision in the legislation in force that allowed, for the purposes of social security rights, the person who had been cohabiting with the deceased to gain the status of a widower.\n\nOn 26 September 2005 the applicant challenged that decision before the Madrid Social Tribunal no. 33 (\u201cthe Social Tribunal\u201d).\n\nIn a judgment of 14 November 2005 the Social Tribunal ruled for the applicant. The Social Tribunal firstly outlined that the facts of the case had to be assessed in the light of the newly enacted Law no. 13/2005, which was already in force and deemed constitutional by the tribunal. As to the merits, the Social Tribunal observed that the issue at stake was whether the applicant, as the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship that ended (following his partner\u2019s death) before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, had the right to a survivor\u2019s pension. The Social Tribunal then reiterated that, according to the well-established domestic case-law, surviving partners of unmarried couples were not entitled to a survivor\u2019s pension under section 174 of the General Social Security Act, marriage being a constitutive element to access any such social-security benefit; that the applicant had been prevented from marrying his partner because same-sex marriage had not been recognised in domestic law at the time his partner died; that the social security administration had relied on the fact that the couple had not married to refuse the applicant a survivor\u2019s pension; and that it was evident that after the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, surviving spouses of same-sex marriages were entitled to survivors\u2019 pensions on the same footing as survivors of different-sex marriages.\n\nThe Social Tribunal was of the view that the solution to the legal issue raised by the applicant\u2019s case depended on whether it could be inferred from Law no. 13/2005 that Parliament\u2019s intention had been that surviving partners of same-sex couples who had been prevented from marrying under the former legislation could access a survivor\u2019s pension on a similar footing to same-sex couples who could marry after the entering into force of that Act. The Social Tribunal drew attention in this regard to the provisions and the explanatory memorandum of Law no. 13/2005 to contend that this new legislation had a very strong egalitarian purpose, and that from the date it entered into force, that is to say 3 July 2005, all legal provisions concerning marriage should be interpreted on the basis of the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 as applying fully to same-sex marriage (see paragraph 35 below). The Social Tribunal held in this regard that: \u201cThis is a wide-ranging provision which affects all the other provisions of the legal system making reference to marriage. From now onwards all references to marriage established in the law shall be understood as applying also to marriage celebrated between two persons of the same sex. Accordingly, whoever shall be called to interpret or apply any marriage-related provision should do so in egalitarian terms without taking into consideration whether the spouses are of the same or different sex\u201d.\n\nThe Social Tribunal further recalled that additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 of 7 July 1981 amending the provisions of the Civil Code pertaining to marriage and the procedure to be followed for cases of annulment, judicial separation and divorce, recognised the right to obtain a survivor\u2019s pension for individuals who had been prevented from marrying a person who later died by the legislation in force until then, provided that he or she had cohabited in a relationship similar to marriage with the deceased person and that the deceased had died before Law no. 30/1981 entered into force.\n\nThe Social Tribunal stressed that such a provision was included in order to provide a solution for those cohabiting couples consisting of a man and a woman who could not have married under the legislation in force until that time, and thus did not qualify for a survivor\u2019s pension, because one or even both of them had still been married to another person whom they had been prevented from divorcing, divorce having been legally impossible in Spain until the passing of Law no. 30/1981. The Social Tribunal considered that the applicant\u2019s circumstances were \u201cfully comparable\u201d to those outlined in additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 in so far as: \u201c- the claimant could not marry his partner because the legislation then in force prevented him from doing so;\n\nthe claimant had shared a marital life with his partner until the latter\u2019s death;\n\nthe latter\u2019s death had taken place before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005\u201d\n\nThe Social Tribunal acknowledged, however, that whereas Law no. 30/1981 was aimed at protecting the rights of those cohabiting heterosexual couples who were prevented from marrying because divorce was prohibited at the time, Law no. 13/2005 was aimed at protecting the rights of those who could not marry on account of their sexual orientation, and that this distinction was the main impediment to the recognition of the applicant\u2019s right to a survivor\u2019s pension.\n\nThe Social Tribunal considered nonetheless that treating these two groups differently would not be in harmony with the strong egalitarian intention expressed by Parliament with the passing of Law no. 13/2005 and that, accordingly, additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was applicable to the applicant by force of additional provision no. 1 of Law no. 13/2005. The Social Tribunal stated as follows: \u201cTherefore, the interpretation that in my opinion better fits the legislature\u2019s intention is the following:\n\nIf the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 sets out that provisions making reference to marriage shall apply irrespective of the sex of the spouses,\n\nAnd one of [these provisions], currently in force to provide access to a survivor\u2019s pension, is additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981.\n\nThe only method to apply it in a way which is consistent with the egalitarian intention of the legislature is to do so irrespective of the sexual orientation of the members of the cohabiting couple.\n\nIn order to ensure that sexual orientation does not constitute discriminatory grounds in the application of additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981, the right thereby recognised shall currently be interpreted as providing a solution to factual situations such as the one in the instant case in which the impediment to access to a survivor\u2019s pension is no other than the sexual orientation [of the claimant].\u201d\n\nAs regards the administration\u2019s submission that in the area of social security benefits the governing principle was that of non-retroactivity of laws and that according to the law in force at the time the applicant\u2019s partner died the former did not qualify for a survivor\u2019s pension because they were not married, the Social Tribunal was of the view that this general principle was not absolute and that it did not apply where there was a specific rule giving retroactive effect to laws more favourable to the citizens, as is true of the instant case. Thus, additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 should be read in the light of the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005.\n\nAs to the degree of retroactivity that should be given to additional provision 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 in the applicant\u2019s case, the Social Tribunal relied on the constitutive effects of Law no. 13/2005 which created new rights and was effective only from the date it entered into force. Accordingly, the Social Tribunal recognised the applicant\u2019s right to be awarded a survivor\u2019s pension with effect from 3 July 2005.\n\nThe INSS and the Treasury General of Social Security appealed (recurso de suplicaci\u00f3n) against that judgment to the Madrid High Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justicia).\n\nOn 18 September 2006 the Madrid High Court of Justice upheld the appeal and reversed the first-instance judgment. The court found that the legislature had not intended Law no. 13/2005 to cover same-sex partnerships which had been ended by the death of one of the partners before said law had entered into force and that the lack of protection of these unions could not be considered discriminatory in the light of Article 14 of the Spanish Constitution.\n\nFor the court, it was only as from the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005 that marriage between same-sex couples was recognised and that this law affected other rights for those persons who would wish to marry thereafter. Hence, the court was of the view that Law no. 13/2005 had no retroactive effects, except as otherwise expressly provided, which was not the case at hand.\n\nThe court further stated that even though Law no. 13/2005 had been inspired by the constitutional principle of equality, prior legislation preventing same-sex marriage could not be deemed unconstitutional as contrary to either any constitutional principle or to the right not to be discriminated against. The court referred to constitutional case-law dating from 1994 according to which the requisite of heterosexuality for the purposes of marriage was fully constitutional and that it was within the margin of appreciation of the public authorities to treat heterosexual marriages more favourably than homosexual partnerships. In this connection, the court maintained that despite the reference in the preamble of Law no. 13/2005 (see paragraph 35 below) to the discriminatory treatment to which homosexuals had traditionally been subjected on account of their sexual orientation, the aim of Parliament in passing that law was merely to respond to a new social reality and award homosexuals the right to marry, but not to protect same-sex partnerships which had already ended before its enactment.\n\nThe court referred to constitutional case-law according to which a difference in legal treatment of individuals due to subsequent changes in the law does not necessarily entail discrimination, even if those persons could be said to be in similar circumstances. Given the complexity that a change in legislation might involve, it was for Parliament to establish the characteristics of the legal transition, either by introducing retroactivity clauses or by restricting the application of the new legislation to circumstances arising after its entry into force.\n\nThe court noted in this regard that Law no. 13/2005 had not included any provision concerning same-sex partnerships which had already ended at the time of its entry into force and that it strictly concerned same-sex couples still in existence at that time and who would be willing to enter into marriage. The court considered that the difference between the situations before and after the passing of Law no. 13/2005 was essentially an expression of the principle of succession of laws without constitutional implications as regards the right not to be discriminated against.\n\nAs regards the applicability to the present case of additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981, the Madrid High Court of Justice found that this provision was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case for two main reasons. Firstly, that provision could not be considered as among the provisions to which the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 referred. Additional provision no. 10 (2) was, as the Constitutional Court had established, of a provisional or transitory nature and had been envisaged for those specific cases in which one of the partners had died before the entry into force of Law no. 30/1981. It had not been intended to govern future situations. Secondly, that provision had been envisaged for a totally different situation from that of the applicant. Additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was aimed at guaranteeing a survivor\u2019s pension to those heterosexuals who had been prevented from marrying their out-of wedlock partner because divorce had not been legal at the time of the latter\u2019s death. The inability to remarry for those affected by additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was based on the fact that divorce was not permitted at the time. The institution of marriage was open to them in their capacity as heterosexuals. On the contrary, same-sex couples were absolutely prevented from marrying before Law no. 13/2005 since the institution of marriage was until then restricted to heterosexual couples.\n\nFurthermore, the court contended that the applicant could never have fulfilled the more uxorio marital cohabitation requirement established by additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/ 1981 of, because only those who were in principle eligible for marriage but had been prevented from marrying for whatever reason could qualify for de facto marital cohabitation. The applicant and his partner could have never cohabited \u201cas if married\u201d before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, because before then they were ineligible for marriage as they were both male.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal on points of law seeking harmonisation of the case-law (recurso de casaci\u00f3n para la unificaci\u00f3n de doctrina). In a decision of 27 June 2007, the Supreme Court (Social Chamber) declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the decision produced for purposes of comparison, specifically a judgment of the High Court of Justice of the Canary Islands of 7 November 2003, was not relevant. That decision was served on 26 July 2007.\n\nRelying on Articles 14 (principle of equality and prohibition of discrimination) and 24 \u00a7 1 (right to effective judicial protection), the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. In a decision of 11 February 2009, served on 17 February 2009, the Constitutional Court declared the appeal inadmissible on the grounds that the applicant had failed to substantiate the special constitutional relevance of his complaints."}

the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nThe first applicant, Mr Douglas Gary Vinter, is a British national who was born in 1969 and is currently detained at HMP Frankland. He is represented before the Court by Mr S. Creighton, a lawyer practising in London with Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, assisted by Mr P. Weatherby, counsel, and Professor D. van Zyl Smit.\n\nThe second applicant, Mr Jeremy Neville Bamber, is a British national who was born in 1961 and is currently detained at HMP Full Sutton. He is represented before the Court by Mr B. Woods, a lawyer practising in Leeds with Cousins Tyrer Solicitors, assisted by Mr R. Horwell QC and Mr L.

He is represented before the Court by Chivers Solicitors, Bingley, assisted by Mr M. McKone, counsel.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms L. Dauban of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicants alleged that the whole life orders which had been imposed on them violated Articles 3, 5 \u00a7 4, 6 and 7 of the Convention.\n\nOn 1 February 2011, the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nA. Introduction\n\nSince the abolition of the death penalty in England and Wales, the sentence for murder has been a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. When such a sentence is imposed, it is the current practice, in the majority of cases, for the trial judge to set a minimum term of imprisonment which must be served before the prisoner is eligible for release on licence. Exceptionally, however, \u201ca whole life order\u201d may be imposed by the trial judge instead of a minimum term. This has the effect that the prisoner cannot be released other than at the discretion of the Secretary of State. (The power of the Secretary of State to release a prisoner is provided for in section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.) The Secretary of State will only exercise his discretion on compassionate grounds when the prisoner is terminally ill or seriously incapacitated (see Prison Service Order 4700 set out at paragraph 36 below).\n\nPrior to the entry into force of the 2003 Act, it was the practice for the mandatory life sentence to be passed by the trial judge but for the Secretary of State, after receiving recommendations from the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice, to decide the minimum term of imprisonment which the prisoner would have to serve before he would be eligible for early release on licence. This was also referred to as the \u201ctariff\u201d part of the sentence and was taken to represent the minimum period which the prisoner was required to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. It was open to the Secretary of State to impose a whole life tariff on a prisoner. In such a case, it was the practice of the Secretary of State to review a whole life tariff after twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment to determine whether it was still justified, particularly with reference to cases where the prisoner had made exceptional progress in prison (see Hindley at paragraph 39 below). With the entry into force of the 2003 Act (and, in particular, section 276 and schedule 22 to the Act), all prisoners whose tariffs were set by the Secretary of State have been able to apply to the High Court for review of that tariff. Upon such an application the High Court may set a minimum term of imprisonment or make a whole life order.\n\nThis case concerns three applicants who, having been convicted of murder in separate criminal proceedings in England and Wales, are currently serving mandatory sentences of life imprisonment. All three applicants have been given whole life orders: in the first applicant\u2019s case this order was made by the trial judge under the current practice; in the case of the second and third applicants, who were convicted and sentenced prior to the entry into force of the 2003 Act, the orders were made by the High Court. All three applicants maintain that these whole life orders, as they apply to their cases, are incompatible inter alia with Articles 3 and 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. The facts of the applications, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nB. Mr Vinter\n\nOn 20 May 1996, the first applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a work colleague, with a minimum term of 10 years. He was released on licence on 4 August 2005.\n\nHe began living with a woman who was to become the victim of his second murder offence. The couple married on 27 June 2006. On 31 December 2006 the first applicant was involved in a fight in a public house and charged with affray (using or threatening unlawful violence). His licence was revoked and he was recalled to prison. In July 2007, having pleaded guilty to the charge of affray, he was sentenced to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment. He was released on licence again in December 2007 and returned to live with his wife and her four children. The couple became estranged and the first applicant left the marital home.\n\nOn 5 February 2008, the first applicant followed his wife to a public house. He had been drinking and had taken cocaine. The couple argued and the wife\u2019s daughter, who was present, telephoned the police to alert them to the dispute. The first applicant ordered his wife to get into a car. When the daughter tried to get into the car to protect her mother, the first applicant forcibly removed her. He then drove off with his wife. When the police telephoned her to ascertain if she was safe, the first applicant forced his wife to tell them that she was fine. The first applicant also telephoned the police to tell them that his wife was safe and well. Some hours later he gave himself up to the police, telling them that he had killed her. A post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had a broken nose, deep and extensive bruising to her neck (which was consistent with attempted strangulation), and four stab wounds to the chest. Two knives were found at the scene, one of which had a broken blade.\n\nThe first applicant pleaded guilty to murder and instructed his counsel not to make any submissions in mitigation lest it add to the grief of the victim\u2019s family. The trial judge considered that the first applicant fell into that small category of people who should be deprived permanently of their liberty. He passed the mandatory life sentence and made a whole life order.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on 25 June 2009. It considered the general principles for determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence (as set out in schedule 21 to the 2003 Act: see relevant domestic law and practice below). It found that, given the circumstances of the offence, there was no reason whatever to depart from the normal principle enshrined in schedule 21 to the 2003 Act that, where murder was committed by someone who was already a convicted murderer, a whole life order was appropriate for punishment and deterrence.\n\nC. Mr Bamber\n\nOn 7 August 1985, the second applicant\u2019s parents, his adoptive sister and her two young children were shot and killed. The second applicant was subsequently charged and, on 28 October 1986, convicted of the murders. The prosecution\u2019s case was that the murders were premeditated and planned and had been committed for financial gain. It was also alleged that the second applicant had arranged the crime scene so as to mislead the police by making it appear as if his adoptive sister had killed the family and then herself.\n\nThe trial judge recommended to the Secretary of State that the second applicant serve twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment \u201cas a minimum\u201d (his underlining). On the trial judge\u2019s letter to the Secretary of State, the Lord Chief Justice added the comment \u201cfor my part I would never release him\u201d. In 1988, the Secretary of State imposed a whole life tariff. The practice at the time was not to inform the prisoner of this decision. By letter dated 15 December 1994, the applicant was informed that the Secretary of State had concluded that the requirements of retribution and deterrence could only be satisfied by the second applicant remaining in prison for the whole of his life.\n\nIn 2008, following the entry into force of section 276 and schedule 22 to the 2003 Act, the second applicant applied to the High Court for review of the whole life tariff. Having regard to schedule 21 to the Act, the High Court concluded that, given the number of murders involved and the presence of premeditation by the second applicant, the offence plainly fell within that category of cases where the appropriate starting point was a whole life order. Having further regard to statements submitted by the victims\u2019 next-of-kin and submissions by the second applicant, including reports as to the behaviour and progress he had made in prison, the High Court found that there was no reason to depart from the views of the Lord Chief Justice and the Secretary of State. It therefore imposed a whole life order.\n\nThe second applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal on 14 May 2009. The court found that, when the Secretary of State had set a whole life tariff in 1988, he had been provided with two different judicial recommendations: one from the trial judge recommending a minimum term of twenty-five years and one from the Lord Chief Justice recommending that the second applicant should never be released. The Secretary of State had been entitled to choose between those recommendations or to adopt neither of them. The Court of Appeal also found that the whole life order imposed by the High Court was not only correct but, for the purposes of punishment and retribution, fully justified.\n\nRelying on its previous judgment in R v. Bieber (see paragraph 40 below), it found that no issue arose under Article 3 of the Convention as the whole life order was not an irreducible life sentence as that term had been used in Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, ECHR 2008\u2011... Finally, following its ruling in R v. Pitchfork (see paragraph 41 below) it found that the review procedure created by the 2003 Act was compatible with Article 7 of the Convention as, properly construed, the relevant statutory provisions meant a prisoner could not be disadvantaged by the outcome of the review: the term to be served could be reduced, or maintained, but it could not be increased or extended.\n\nThe second applicant applied to the Court of Appeal to certify that its judgment concerned a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by the House of Lords. That application was refused on 23 June 2009.\n\nD. Mr Moore\n\nOn 29 November 1996 the third applicant was convicted after trial in the Crown Court at Chester of four counts of murder. The victims were homosexual men and the applicant, himself a homosexual, was alleged to have committed the murders for his own sexual gratification. Each victim was stabbed many times with a large combat knife which the third applicant had bought for that purpose. The first victim was attacked in his home on 23 September 1995. Soon after, on the weekend of 7 October 1995, the third applicant met his second victim in a bar and arranged to take him home for sex; he instead took him to a forest, stabbed him to death and left the body there. The third victim was stabbed in the caravan where he lived on 30 November 1995. Finally, shortly before Christmas 1995, the third applicant went to a beach which was well-known for homosexual trysts. He met the fourth victim on the beach and stabbed him there.\n\nBlood from the first and third victims was found on the third applicant\u2019s jacket and on the knife. Property from the first, second and fourth victims was found in his possession. He made extensive admissions about all four murders to the police. The police had been unaware of the second victim until the third applicant mentioned him to them. The body was recovered from the forest with his assistance. At trial, the applicant\u2019s defence was that the murders had been committed by someone else, though he admitted to having been present at all the murders save for that of the second victim.\n\nAfter the third applicant was convicted, the trial judge passed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and recommended to the Secretary of State for the Home Department that, in his view, the applicant should never be released. Upon review, the Lord Chief Justice reported that he thought the minimum period before eligibility for release should be set at thirty years. On 27 September 2002, the Secretary of State decided to set a whole life tariff.\n\nIn 2008, pursuant to section 276 and schedule 22 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the third applicant applied to the High Court for review of the whole life tariff set by the Secretary of State. In its judgment of 12 June 2008 the High Court rejected the third applicant\u2019s submission that it should accept the Lord Chief Justice\u2019s recommendation of a minimum term of thirty years. It found that, while weight should be accorded to that recommendation, the Lord Chief Justice did not have regard to the principles set out in schedule 21 as the High Court was required to do. It also rejected the submission that an issue arose under Article 6 given that a whole life tariff had been set by the Secretary of State. The High Court found that the procedure for applying to the High Court under section 276 and schedule 22 of the Act provided the necessary independent review as to whether a prisoner should be released. The court also found that a whole life order would be compatible with Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. Having regard to the general principles for determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence (as set out in schedule 21 to the Act), no issue of arbitrariness arose and whether such a sentence was disproportionate depended on the facts of each case.\n\nThe High Court found that, since the case involved the murder of two or more persons, sexual or sadistic conduct and a substantial degree of premeditation, under schedule 21 the starting point was a whole life order. There were no mitigating features and even the Lord Chief Justice, in recommending a minimum term of thirty years, had shared the trial judge\u2019s view that it might never be safe to release the third applicant. There were no reasons, therefore, to mitigate the starting point of a whole life order. The High Court added that, even if the starting point were a minimum term of thirty years, the aggravating features of the murders were such as to make a whole life order appropriate.\n\nOn 26 February 2009, the Court of Appeal dismissed the third applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that the High Court was not only entitled, but clearly right, to conclude that a whole life order was appropriate.\n\nIt appears that the third applicant, in order to allow him to appeal to the House of Lords, then applied to the Court of Appeal to certify that its judgment concerned a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by the House of Lords. On 14 August 2009, he was informed by the Court of Appeal\u2019s Criminal Appeal Office that, because the Court of Appeal had refused his application for permission to appeal against sentence (as opposed to granting permission to appeal against sentence and then dismissing the appeal), an application to certify a point of law for the House of Lords could not be made."}

applications (nos. 27080/08 and 40982/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Metin K\u00f6ksal and Mr Servet Durdu (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 29 May and 15 August 2008, respectively. The first applicant, Mr K\u00f6ksal, was represented by Mr H. \u00c7ak\u0131ro\u011flu, a lawyer practising in Samsun. The second applicant, Mr Durdu, was represented by Mr M. Bayat, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 May 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nThe applicants were born in 1973 and 1965, respectively, and live in Samsun and Ankara.\n\nA. Application no. 27080/08\n\nOn 17 October 2001 the applicant was discharged from his civil service post following his previous criminal conviction by a martial law court. The conviction had been finalised by the Military Court of Cassation's decision of 11 November 1997.\n\nOn 4 January 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Samsun Administrative Court to annul the discharge order.\n\nOn 5 June 2002 the Samsun Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request.\n\nOn 7 February 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Samsun Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur (\u201ctetkik hakimi\u201d) concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 31 December 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for rectification of its previous decision.\n\nB. Application no. 40982/08\n\nOn 11 January 2002 the applicant was discharged from his civil service post after a disciplinary decision. Criminal proceedings were also commenced against the applicant on the same grounds as those which had led to his discharge.\n\nOn 15 March 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Ankara Administrative Court to annul the discharge order.\n\nOn 25 June 2002 the Ankara Assize Court acquitted the applicant of the offences with which he had been charged. On 22 March 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's acquittal.\n\nIn the meantime, on 31 March 2003 the Ankara Administrative Court refused the applicant's request to annul the discharge order. Relying on Section 131 of the Law on Civil Servants (Law no. 657), the administrative court held that the applicant's acquittal of the criminal charges did not absolve him from the disciplinary sanction.\n\nOn 26 April 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 23 January 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's rectification request. The final decision was served on the applicant on 4 March 2008."}

Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Andrzej Pisk-Piskowski (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 13 November 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 24 March 2004 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Opole, Poland.\n\nA. The criminal proceedings\n\nIn 1998 the prosecution service filed with the Opole District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) a bill of indictment in which it charged the applicant with making unlawful threats. In the course of the court proceedings the applicant was represented by a court-appointed lawyer. On 6 November 2001 the trial court held a hearing at which the applicant and his court\u2011appointed lawyer were present. During the hearing, the court scheduled the next hearing for 4 December 2001 about which the applicant was informed.\n\nOn 4 December 2001 a hearing took place before the trial court. The applicant did not attend the hearing but his counsel was present. The applicant failed to give any reasons for his absence and the trial court finished the proceedings and decided in the presence of the counsel that the judgment would be delivered on 11 December 2001.\n\nOn 11 December 2001 the Opole District Court delivered a judgment in which it convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to a prison term of one year and six months. Neither the applicant nor his counsel was present at the delivery of the judgment.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal against the judgment of 11 December 2001 and did not apply for a copy of the reasons of that judgment.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant lodged an application for leave to apply for a reasoned judgment out of time. In his application, he argued that his absence at the hearing held on 4 December 2001 was justified because he had been recently released from the detention and on 5 December 2001 he had been assaulted. The applicant also complained that he had not been informed about the date of the delivery of the judgment. On 9 April 2002 the Opole District Court examined the application and dismissed it. The court, in a reasoned decision, established that the applicant had known about the hearing scheduled for 4 December 2001. He failed to attend it without providing any justification for his absence. Therefore, the trial court was entitled to terminate the proceedings in his absence on the basis of Article 376 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court further examined the reasons for the absence submitted by the applicant. It established that in fact he had been released on 22 November 2001 - two weeks prior to the hearing. Moreover, while it was true that the applicant had been assaulted, nevertheless, that had happened the day following the hearing and the injuries sustained by the applicant, according to a hospital certificate, were not serious and the applicant was not admitted to hospital. With regard to the complaint that he was not informed about the date of the delivery of the judgment, the court found that the applicant had not been diligent since he had not contacted his lawyer. The applicant was aware of the scheduled hearing and knew the address and the name of his court\u2011appointed lawyer. The applicant appealed against this decision. On 16 May 2003 the Opole Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) examined the reasons given by the District Court and upheld the decision.\n\nOn 14 January 2002 the applicant started serving the prison sentence ordered by the judgment of 11 December 2001.\n\nB. The monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence\n\nOn 6 December 2002 the Court received the applicant\u2019s first letter dated 13 November 2002. The letter was sent while the applicant was serving a prison sentence in the Wroc\u0142aw Detention Centre. The envelope in which the letter was delivered bears the following stamps: \u201cDistrict Court in Legnica, censored on 22.11.02\u201d (S\u0105d Rejonowy w Legnicy, cenzurowano dnia 22.11.02) and \u201c252, 14 NOV 2002, register number 2738/01\u201d (252, 14 LIS 2002, numer ewid. 2738/01)."}

case was referred to the Court, within the period of three months laid down by Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c), by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 16 May 1983 and then by the Government of the Republic of Austria (\u201cthe Government\u201c) on 25 May 1983. The case originated in an application (no. 8790/79) against Austria lodged with the Commission on 19 September 1979 under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mrs. Viera Sramek, a United States citizen. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the Republic of Austria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46), and the Government\u2019s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The purpose of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\n\nIn response to the inquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. G. Wiarda, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b) of the Rules of Court). On 27 May 1983, the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Deputy Registrar, the names of the five other members, namely Mr. Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, Mr. D. Evrigenis, Sir Vincent Evans and Mr. C. Russo (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nHaving assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and having on each occasion consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and Mrs. Sramek\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Wiarda\n\ndecided, on 13 June 1983, that there was no call for memorials to be filed (Rule 37 para. 1);\n\ndirected, on 17 November, that the oral proceedings should open on 24 January 1984 (Rule 38). The Registrar, acting on the President\u2019s instructions, requested the Commission to produce certain documents, which were received on 29 November 1983. On 13 and 14 December, the applicant filed her claims under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention. On 17 December, the President granted the applicant\u2019s lawyer leave to use the German language (Rule 27 para. 3).\n\nThe hearings were held in public at the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. Immediately before they opened, the Court had held a preparatory meeting. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr. H. T\u00fcrk, Legal Adviser in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr. M. Matzka, Federal Chancellery, Mr. G. Liebl, Office of the Government of the Tyrol, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr. F. Ermacora, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr. E. Proksch, Rechtsanwalt, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr. T\u00fcrk and Mr. Matzka for the Government, by Mr. Ermacora for the Commission and by Mr. Proksch for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions. During the course of the hearings, the Government filed a document.\n\nFollowing deliberations held on 26 January, the Chamber decided under Rule 50 of the Rules of Court to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court. Having taken note of the agreement of the Agent of the Government and the concurring opinion of the Commission\u2019s Delegate and Mrs. Sramek\u2019s lawyer, the Court decided on 27 March that the proceedings should continue without resumption of the hearings (Rule 26).\n\nVarious documents were produced to the Court by the Government on 6 February, 27 March and 25 April, and by the applicant on 1 and 7 February and 28 March. The Government also replied on 27 March to two supplementary questions which the Registrar had addressed to them on the instructions of the President.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who is a United States citizen, lives in Munich in the Federal Republic of Germany. Wishing to build a holiday residence in Hopfgarten, a village in the Austrian Tyrol, she approached, with the assistance of municipal officials, the owners of a plot of land which had until then been used for agricultural purposes. Sale negotiations began in 1971 and apparently led, in 1973, to an initial contract. One year later, Mrs. Sramek paid to the vendors the greater part of the agreed price. However, the definitive contract was not drawn up until 13 January 1977.\n\nUnder section 3 of the Tyrolean Real Property Transactions Act (Grundverkehrsgesetz) 1970, as amended by, inter alia, an Act of 28 November 1973 which came into force on 1 January 1974 (\u201cthe 1970/1973 Act\u201c), the contract could not take effect unless it were approved by the local Real Property Transactions Authority (Grundverkehrsbeh\u00f6rde); in fact, it contained a clause which so provided. The 1970/1973 Act applies to agricultural and forestry land and also to any land over which rights are acquired by, in particular, a natural person who does not possess Austrian nationality (section 1(1) and (2)).\n\nThe local Real Property Transactions Authority for Hopfgarten at the office of the Kitzb\u00fchel District Administration (Bezirkshauptmannschaft), to which the contract had been submitted, approved it on 7 March 1977; the decision (Bescheid) was dated 31 March.\n\nOn 6 April, the Real Property Transactions Officer (Landesgrundverkehrsreferent, \u201cthe Transactions Officer\u201c, see paragraph 23 below) at the Government Office of the Tyrol (Amt der Landesregierung) in Innsbruck exercised his right of appeal (Berufung) to the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority (Landesgrundverkehrsbeh\u00f6rde; section 13(3) of the 1970/1973 Act and see paragraphs 22-23 below). In his view, the contract fell foul of section 4(2) of the 1970/1973 Act. Under that sub-section, where the purchaser of real property is a foreigner a contract of the kind in question can be approved only \u201cif the acquisition of rights (Rechtserwerb) is not contrary to political (staatspolitisch), economic, social (sozialpolitisch) or cultural interests; such a conflict (Widerspruch) is deemed to exist, in particular, where, (a) having regard to the extent of existing foreign ownership or to the number of foreign owners, there is a risk of foreign domination (Uberfremdung) in the municipality or locality concerned, (b) ... .\u201c In the submission of the Transactions Officer, there were, in fact, already 110 foreign landowners in Hopfgarten and it could be seen from a series of decisions of the Regional Authority that this municipality was one of those where the danger of foreign domination was imminent. The contract in question was therefore contrary to social and economic interests within the meaning of the above-mentioned Act. The applicant received a copy of the appeal but did not file any observations in reply.\n\nThe Government Office of the Tyrol was organised in a number of \u201cgroups\u201c and each group comprised several \u201cdivisions\u201c. In the present case, the Transactions Officer was the director of group III; his secretariat was provided by one of the seven divisions in that group, namely division III b. 2.\n\nOn 3 June 1977, the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority at the Government Office of the Tyrol held a hearing. The Regional Authority sat in camera but the parties, namely the Transactions Officer and Mrs. Sramek, were present. The latter appeared in person, without the assistance of a lawyer. In accordance with section 13(4), no. 1, of the 1970/1973 Act (see paragraph 24 below), the Regional Authority was composed as follows: the elected mayor of a municipality in the Tyrol, who was a farmer experienced in real estate matters, as chairman; a judge of the Innsbruck Court of Appeal; a civil servant from division III b. 3 - one of the seven divisions in group III - of the Government Office, as rapporteur; the head of group III d; the director of the Regional Forestry Service, being the head of group III f; a farmer; and a lawyer. The secretariat was provided by division III b. 3, to which the rapporteur belonged.\n\nAccording to the minutes of the hearing, the rapporteur presented the facts and read out the expert opinions and observations received during the course of the investigation; the latter concerned, inter alia, the percentage of the parcels of land in Hopfgarten which was in foreign hands. The Transactions Officer then requested the Authority to uphold his appeal on the ground that as there was already a risk of foreign domination in Hopfgarten, the acquisition of the land in question would be contrary to social and political interests. The applicant stated that she had signed the initial contract (Erstvertrag), which could not then be found, on 13 March 1973. As early as 23 January 1971, she had reached an agreement to purchase (Vertragsabsprachen) and had received assurances that all would go well. Since that time, she had come to Austria several times each year to settle the matter. Her husband was living with the family in Munich, where he worked, but would be retiring shortly. She declared that she herself was prepared to apply for Austrian nationality. Their permit to reside in the Federal Republic was temporary and she did not wish to return to the United States. She added that she had already made a first payment of 111,591 schillings. In conclusion, she requested that the contract be approved.\n\nOn the same day, that is 3 June 1977, the Regional Authority upheld the appeal: referring to the above-mentioned section 4(2)(a) of the 1970/1973 Act, it refused to approve the transfer of title. Its decision (Bescheid) was dated 16 June. The Authority noted firstly that according to a statement from the municipality of Hopfgarten, which had not been challenged at the hearing, there were 110 foreign landowners in Hopfgarten, owning 5.6 hectares of land. There were 4,800 inhabitants and 1,100 families in the locality, though not all of them were landowners. The proportion of non-Austrian owners already exceeded 10 per cent and the extent of their holdings revealed a tendency towards foreign domination. The Authority then recalled that for some years past it had been refusing to approve the transfer of land in Hopfgarten to foreigners since it had concluded that there was a risk of foreign domination in the area. It had to take account, inter alia, of the effects of its decision on third parties. According to the Authority, experience showed that the approval of a contract between a landowner and a foreigner led to an influx of other foreigners who also wished to buy land in the locality. This caused prices to rise substantially, making it very difficult, if not impossible, for the indigenous population to find housing for themselves. For these reasons and in view of the scarcity of building plots in the Tyrol, very strict legal (gesetzlich) control had to be exercised: sales and purchases could normally be approved only if they contributed to the establishment or maintenance of an effective (leistungsf\u00e4hig) agricultural population or if they served to satisfy domestic land needs (inl\u00e4ndischer Bodenbedarf) for any kind of public or social purposes. However, Mrs. Sramek was intending to use the land in question - at least for some time - for the construction of a holiday residence. Such an objective could easily be satisfied by the local hotel trade which, furthermore, was losing potential customers as a result of the construction of villas by foreigners. The acquisition contemplated was therefore prejudicial to economic and social interests and thus fell foul of, in particular, section 4(2)(a) of the 1970/1973 Act. Lastly, the Regional Authority rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that she had already concluded a contract in 1973, that is at a time when American citizens were treated on an equal footing with Austrians by virtue of a bilateral treaty dating from 1928. The Authority emphasised firstly that it had to base itself on the factual and legal situation obtaining at the time when the decision had to be taken. In its view, the 1928 treaty had not established any equality between citizens of the two States in the area concerned. In the case in question, the transfer of ownership contemplated fell under Article 1 para. 2, as interpreted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a 1973 memorandum which stated that the general regulations with regard to foreigners were applicable. Even if this interpretation had not been known at the time when the initial contract had allegedly been concluded (13 March 1973, see paragraph 14 above) - though this was not the case, since the above-mentioned memorandum dated from early 1973 -, Mrs. Sramek could not claim that she had acted in good faith: she was obliged under section 15 of the 1970/1973 Act to seek approval of the contract within two months and she alone bore the responsibility for not having done so.\n\nOn 22 August 1977, the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) against the decision of the Regional Authority. She claimed that her right to inviolability of property and her right to a decision by the legally competent court (gesetzlicher Richter) had been infringed and relied on Article 5 of the Basic Law (Staatsgrundgesetz), Article 83 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) and Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. As concerns the first complaint, Mrs. Sramek alleged that the Regional Authority had applied section 4(2)(a) of the 1970/1973 Act in a misconceived (denkunm\u00f6glich) manner by adopting an illogical approach; amongst other things, it had concluded that there was a danger of foreign domination in Hopfgarten without being in possession of detailed documentation, without defining the risk in question and without enquiring into the actual position in Hopfgarten regarding real property ownership. She further contended that the Regional Authority was not an \u201cindependent tribunal\u201c within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. On these grounds, she requested the Constitutional Court to annul the decision under appeal or, in the alternative, to refer the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). Mrs. Sramek supplemented her grounds of appeal on 9 March 1978. She asserted that her lawyer had not been able to consult the minutes of the Regional Authority\u2019s deliberations. She had, in fact, learnt that the Authority had not given its ruling on 3 June 1977, immediately after the closure of the hearing. She inferred from this that the decision complained of had not been taken by the legally competent court. She requested the Constitutional Court to provide her lawyer with an opportunity of reading the above-mentioned minutes.\n\nThe Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal on 3 March 1979 (Erkenntnisse und Beschl\u00fcsse des Verfassungsgerichtshofes, 1979, vol. 44, no. 8501). It took the view that the Regional Authority was indeed a \u201ctribunal\u201c within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. It gave decisions which the executive could neither annul nor vary. As regards its members - who included a judge -, they had a degree of independence equal to that of judges. They were not bound by any instructions in the exercise of their functions and they could not be removed during their three-year term of office, except for reasons which would have precluded their appointment or if they were permanently prevented from carrying out their duties. The Constitutional Court accordingly held that Article 6 (art. 6) had not been violated. The applicant\u2019s other ground of appeal was also rejected. Recalling that it had already held in another case, in 1974, that it was not misconceived to conclude that there was a danger of foreign domination in Hopfgarten, the Constitutional Court stated that it saw no reason to change its opinion in the instant case. As regards the facts noted by the Regional Authority, they had not been the subject of any dispute during the administrative proceedings. The Constitutional Court sat in camera and gave judgment without holding a hearing.\n\nEven before the above-mentioned judgment had been delivered, the plot in question was sold to an Austrian who, according to the Government, turned it back into grazing-land. The Regional Authority had taken the view that it could examine the new contract, provided that its decision was held in abeyance pending the outcome of the Constitutional Court\u2019s proceedings.\n\nThe Government stated that during the last ten years or so the Regional Authority had not approved any acquisition of real property in Hopfgarten by a foreigner. They supplied a list of thirteen refusals in the period between July 1973 and February 1983; according to the applicant, the list was insufficiently detailed to be conclusive.\n\nII. RELEVANT LEGISLATION\n\nUnder Article 15 of the Federal Constitution, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court, the regulation of real property transactions is a matter coming within the jurisdiction of the L\u00e4nder. Most of the L\u00e4nder have enacted legislation whereby all contracts relating to agricultural or forestry land and also, in some cases, real property transactions with foreigners have to be approved by special authorities.\n\nIn the Tyrol (see paragraph 9 above), section 15(1) of the 1970/1973 Act obliges the purchaser to seek such approval within two months of the conclusion of the contract. No entry can be made in the land register until the transaction has been approved by the competent authority (section 1(4)). If approval is withheld, the acquisition is null and void (section 16(1)).\n\nWhen the contract relates to agricultural or forestry land and irrespective of the purchaser\u2019s nationality, the first-instance authority is the H\u00f6fekommission (\u201cFarm Commission\u201c) (section 13(1)(a)). The Farm Commission is established at the seat of the District Administration and has three members: the head of the District Administration, or a legally qualified (rechtskundig) official of that Administration appointed by him, as chairman; a person designated by the chamber of agriculture of the district; and another person, designated by the municipality in question, who is engaged in agriculture or forestry (section 9 of the Tyrolean Farms Act of 12 June 1900; Gesetz betreffend die besonderen Rechtsverh\u00e4ltnisse geschlossener H\u00f6fe). The decisions of the Farm Commission are taken by majority vote (section 13(2) of the 1970/1973 Act); they are subject to appeal to the Regional Authority (see paragraph 24 below) by, amongst others, the parties to the contract or the Transactions Officer (section 13(3)).\n\nThe Transactions Officer, who is appointed for three years by the Government of the Tyrol, must be a person who is experienced in real property transaction matters (section 14). His secretariat is provided by a division of the Office of the said Government.\n\nIf the case is referred to it, the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority established at the Office of the Land Government takes a decision as the second and final instance (section 13(4)). Its membership varies according to the subject-matter of the contract to be examined. In the case of agricultural or forestry land - whether the buyer be Austrian or foreign - its voting members are (section 13(4), no. 1): \u201c(a) a person experienced in real property transaction matters, who shall act as chairman; (b) a member of the judiciary (Richterstand); (c) a legally qualified civil servant from the Office of the Regional Government, with training in real property transaction matters, who shall act as rapporteur; (d) a senior civil servant from the Agricultural Services Department (technischer Agrardienst) of the Office of the Regional Government; (e) a senior civil servant from the Forestry Services Department (forsttechnischer Dienst); (f) an agricultural expert; (g) a lawyer (Rechtsanwalt or Notar).\u201c\n\nThe above-cited provision, which was introduced by the Act of 28 November 1973 (see paragraph 9 above), replaced a text which the Constitutional Court had held to be incompatible with Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, as interpreted by the European Court in its Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971 (Series A no. 13). The Constitutional Court had ruled that the Regional Authority, as it was constituted under the original Act of 1970, could not be considered an \u201cindependent and impartial\u201c tribunal because its members included, as chairman, one of the members of the Government of the Tyrol (section 13(1), no. 1(a), former version). Furthermore, so the Constitutional Court held, the Act did not fix the duration of the members\u2019 term of office, conferred on the said Government the power of appointing the members (save for a judge, who was appointed by the Federal Minister of Justice) and did not lay down the circumstances in which members might be removed from office (judgment of 29 June 1973, Erkenntnisse und Beschl\u00fcsse des Verfassungsgerichtshofes, 1973, vol. 38, no. 7099).\n\nFollowing this judgment, the Tyrolean legislature amended, by the same Act of 28 November 1973, the provisions in section 13 concerning, inter alia, exercise of the office of member of the Regional Authority. Sub-sections 5 to 13 of that section read as follows: \u201c(5) The member of the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority appointed from the judiciary (sub-section 4, no. 1 (b)), shall be appointed by the Federal Minister of Justice and the remaining members, by the Regional Government. For each member a substitute member shall be similarly appointed. (6) Only Austrian citizens who have reached the age of 25 years and are in full possession of their legal rights shall be eligible for appointment as members or substitute members. Persons who by reason of a criminal conviction are disqualified from jury service or from acting as lay assessors shall be ineligible. (7) Members and substitute members shall hold office for three years. Members or substitute members who are appointed within the general three-year term of office shall cease to hold office at the end of that term. Re-appointment is possible. Members and substitute members shall continue to perform their duties after expiry of their term of office until they have been replaced. (8) The quorum of the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority shall be constituted if the chairman, the member appointed from the judiciary, the rapporteur and at least two other members are present. Decisions shall be taken by majority vote. If the votes are equally divided, the chairman shall have a casting vote. Abstention shall count as a negative vote. (9) In the performance of their duties the members of the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority shall not be subject to any instructions; the executive may neither annul nor vary their decisions. (10) The details of the Real Property Transactions Authorities\u2019 procedure (such as the convening of sittings, summoning of substitute members, conduct of voting, keeping of minutes and signing of decisions) shall be laid down by the Regional Government in rules of procedure (Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung) for the said Authorities. (11) Unless they are civil servants, members of the Real Property Transactions Authorities shall receive for their work remuneration and a travel allowance, the amount of which shall be laid down in regulations made by the Regional Government. (12) A member or substitute member shall be removed from office, before the end of his term of office, if: (a) circumstances intervene which would have made him ineligible for appointment; (b) the regular performance of his duties becomes per80 manently impossible. (13) If an official of a \u201cterritorial\u201c authority (Gebietsk\u00f6rperschaft) is suspended from duty under the regulations governing his employment, he shall cease to exercise his functions as a member or substitute member of a Real Property Transactions Authority for the duration of the suspension.\u201c Sub-section (9), cited above, corresponds to Article 20 para. 2 of the Constitution, which reads: \u201cIf a Federal or a Land Act makes provision for the last-instance decision to be given by a collegiate body at least one of whose members is a judge and whose decisions cannot be annulled or varied by the executive, the other members of that body shall also not be subject to any instructions.\u201c Article 20 para. 3 of the Federal Constitution obliges the members of the Regional Authority not to disclose facts which have come to their knowledge in the exercise of their functions, if the interests of a \u201cterritorial\u201c authority or of the parties so require (Amtsverschwiegenheit).\n\nProcedure before the Real Property Transactions Authorities is governed by the General Administrative Procedure Act 1950 (Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz). The parties are entitled to consult the case-file (section 17) and must be given an opportunity of presenting their arguments (section 37). The competent authority may decide to hold a hearing (section 39(2)), which will not take place in public; the parties have the right to be heard (rechtliches Geh\u00f6r) and, inter alia, to adduce their arguments and evidence and comment on facts presented and submissions made by other persons appearing, witnesses or experts (section 43(3)). In certain circumstances which may give reason to doubt his impartiality, the civil servant concerned must arrange to be replaced (section 7).\n\nBy an order (Verordnung) of 13 September 1966, the Government of the Tyrol issued rules of procedure for the Real Property Transactions Authorities. Under Article 3 para. 1, the Authorities shall deliberate and vote in the absence of the parties, if appropriate after oral hearings. The deliberations shall be recorded in minutes to which the right to consult the case-file (Akteneinsicht), guaranteed by Article 17 of the General Administrative Procedure Act, does not extend (Article 3 para. 3). The Authorities\u2019 resolutions (Beschl\u00fcsse) must be recorded, but may be altered as long as they remain unpublished (nicht nach aussen in Erscheinung getreten) (Article 3 para. 4). Their decisions (Bescheide), which are to be reached on the basis of those resolutions (Article 4 para. 1), shall be given in writing but may in case of urgency be given orally by the chairman (Article 4 para. 2). Before the Regional Real Property Transactions Authority, the rapporteur shall, after setting out and commenting on the results of the investigation (Ermittlungsverfahren), present conclusions (Antrag); those who wish to propose alternative conclusions (Gegen- oder Ab\u00e4nderungsantr\u00e4ge) shall give reasons for them (Article 9 para. 2). The chairman shall decide the order in which voting on the conclusions is to take place (Article 9 para. 3).\n\nDecisions of a Regional Authority may be challenged before the Constitutional Court but not before the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof; Articles 133 para. 4 and 144 of the Federal Constitution). PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nIn her application of 19 September 1979 to the Commission (no. 8790/79), Mrs. Sramek alleged that she had not received a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law; she relied on Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n\nOn 4 March 1982, the Commission declared the application admissible. In its report of 8 December 1982 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion, by eleven votes to one, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the separate opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment\uf02a. FINAL SUBMISSIONS PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nAt the close of the hearings on 24 January 1984, the Government requested the Court \u201cto hold that in the present case the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 6 (art. 6-1) of the Convention ... were not violated and that, as a consequence, the facts underlying the dispute do not indicate any breach by the Republic of Austria of its obligations under the Convention\u201c."}

the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Dariusz Nowak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 11 April 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 January 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. The President of the Chamber also decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the proceedings in the present case should be conducted simultaneously with those in the cases of Michalak v. Poland and Owczar v. Poland (applications nos. 16864/02 and 34117/02) (Rule 42 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Brzeg.\n\nOn 21 May 1999 the Brzeg District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) issued a \u201cwanted\u201d notice in respect of the applicant and several other men in connection with an investigation into allegations made by six women, some of whom were minors, that a group of several men had raped them, threatened them, beaten them and forced them to take drugs. The warrant for arrest was issued after the prosecution service had established that the applicant had gone into hiding and the police had unsuccessfully attempted to arrest him.\n\nOn 21 July 1999 the police attempted to arrest the applicant. However he managed to escape trying in the process to run over police officers while driving away. Two other men sought under the arrest warrant issued in connection with the same investigation were apprehended and arrested.\n\nOn 9 August 1999 the applicant was arrested by the police. At the time of arrest he was in possession of a firearm and a forged identification document. On 13 August 1999 the Opole District Court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the following offences: repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty while acting in an organised criminal gang; leading an organised gang; supplying minor victims with drugs; forging an identification document; and destroying a police car. The court also found that, given that he had absconded in the past, there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding again and try to influence the victims.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision ordering his detention on remand but his appeal was dismissed on 3 September 1999 by the Opole Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy).\n\nOn 18 October 1999 the Opole Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention relying on the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences and on the complexity of the investigation which had not yet been terminated by the prosecutor.\n\nOn 13 December 1999 the court decided that the applicant's detention should be prolonged. It considered that, in addition to the strong suspicion against the applicant, the severity of the sentence that might be imposed and the risk of his tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses justified holding him in custody. In addition, the court relied on the risk that, given that he had absconded in the past, he might go into hiding again. The court also observed that only detention on remand would secure the applicant's appearance at the trial.\n\nOn 16 December 1999 the applicant was indicted before the Opole Regional Court. It appears that the first hearing was held on 26 April 2000. In 2000 the trial court held in total 13 hearings.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant's detention was prolonged by decisions of 12 June and 13 November 2000 and 15 May 2001. The decisions were based on the reasons given for his detention on previous occasions.\n\nAfterwards, as the length of the applicant's detention had reached the statutory time\u2011limit of 2 years laid down in Article 263 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego), the Regional Court applied to the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) asking for the applicant's detention to be prolonged beyond that term. On 28 June 2001 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal allowed the application and prolonged his pre\u2011trial detention. The Court of Appeal based its decision on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed serious offences and on the risk that he might interfere with the course of justice. The court further considered that the complexity of the case constituted a special circumstance justifying his remaining in custody.\n\nOn 7 November 2001 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal again decided to prolong the pre-trial detention of the applicant, finding that the initial reasons for the detention were still valid. Furthermore, the court examined the course of the proceedings before the Opole Regional Court and agreed that the case was particularly complex and time-consuming, given the number of accused and the considerable amount of evidence which had to be examined. It considered that the trial court had acted diligently as it had taken evidence from nineteen witnesses during the last seven hearings.\n\nOn 13 February 2002 the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention until 15 May 2002. The court noted that the applicant had been detained on remand for a long time. However, it considered that the particular circumstances of the case justified keeping him in custody until 15 May 2002 by which time the trial should have been completed.\n\nNevertheless, the trial court again applied to prolong the applicant's detention. On 8 May 2002 the Court of Appeal granted the application. However, it criticised the Regional Court for the delay in the case and requested the trial court \u201cto take adequate and more intensive action to finish the trial\u201d. The court further took into account that the accused were partly responsible for the length of the proceedings because they had lodged vexatious applications for new evidence to be heard and had not complied with time-limits for filing new submissions.\n\nThe applicant's numerous applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention were to no avail.\n\nThe Opole Regional Court held 23 hearings in 2001 and 21 hearings in 2002. On 31 July 2002 the Opole Regional Court gave a judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of several counts of repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty and false imprisonment committed while acting in an organised criminal gang. The applicant was also convicted of administering an unknown psychotropic substance to some of the victims and use of a forged identity document. The court acquitted the applicant of being the leader of the organised criminal gang. The applicant was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment. The applicant and other co\u2011accused appealed.\n\nOn 2 June 2003 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal gave a judgment. It amended the first-instance judgment with respect to the applicant reducing his prison sentence to 10 years and 8 months. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy).\n\nOn 11 March 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded."}

an application (no. 4524/06) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Y\u0131lmaz Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Mr Kamiran Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Mr Mehmet Metin \u00c7\u0131lg\u0131n (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 3 January 2006.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr \u00d6. T\u00fcrkdo\u011fan, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicants alleged that there had been an interference with their right to freedom of assembly and their right to freedom of expression.\n\nOn 14 January 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants are Turkish nationals who were born in 1972, 1965 and 1961 respectively. Mr Y\u0131lmaz Y\u0131ld\u0131z lives in Ni\u011fde and the others live in Mardin.\n\nThe first applicant, Y\u0131lmaz Y\u0131ld\u0131z, is a health officer and the branch chairman of the Health and Social Services Workers\u2019 Union (Sa\u011fl\u0131k ve Sosyal Hizmet Emek\u00e7ileri Sendikas\u0131 \u2013 \u201cthe SES\u201d) in Ni\u011fde. The second applicant, Kamiran Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, is a doctor and the branch chairman of the SES in Mardin. The third applicant, Mehmet Metin \u00c7\u0131lg\u0131n, is a doctor and also a member of the SES in Mardin.\n\nOn 4 February 2005 several members of the union gathered in front of the Ni\u011fde Social Security Institution (Sosyal Sigortalar Kurumu \u2013 \u201cthe SSK\u201d) Hospital. Subsequently the first applicant read out the SES\u2019s press statement drawing attention to the problems that could arise as a consequence of the transfer of hospitals incorporated in the SSK to the Ministry of Health.\n\nThe statement read as follows: \u201cFor the attention of the press and the public: Hospitals incorporated in the SSK have been transferred to the Ministry of Health pursuant to Law no. 5283. Following that structural change patients were unable to take their medication for a long time and hospital staff have been working in a tense atmosphere. Before the structural changes our union warned the Government and the public. The probable administrative and bureaucratic problems were pointed out: SSK was going to be under a huge economic burden, people would have to pay for health care services and an additional tax was going to be imposed on workers. Our union maintains that the Government should allocate more funds from the budget to the health care services to redress the structural problems. Our union states that all citizens should be provided with equal, accessible, sufficient and free health care services.\u201d\n\nOn 25 February 2005 the second and third applicants together with another thirty persons gathered in the Mardin Yeni\u015fehir SSK Hospital yard. Subsequently, the second applicant read out the press statement in his capacity as chairman of the Mardin branch of the union.\n\nThe police did not prevent anyone from entering the yard during either gathering. Nor did they interfere with the demonstrations or the reading out of the press statements.\n\nAccording to the police reports of 4 February 2005 in Ni\u011fde and 25 February 2005 in Mardin, the two groups of demonstrators had been warned verbally that their gatherings were illegal and ordered to disband for the protection of public order and safety.\n\nThe Ni\u011fde and Mardin public prosecutors filed indictments charging the applicants with intentionally disobeying orders issued by the authorities aimed at protecting public order and safety, pursuant to section 32 of the Misdemeanours Act, Law No. 5326 (see paragraph 17 below).\n\nOn 8 June and 14 July 2005 the Mardin Magistrates\u2019 Court and the Ni\u011fde Magistrates\u2019 Court, respectively, convicted the applicants as charged and imposed on them administrative fines of 100 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 62 euros (EUR)).\n\nThe applicants appealed against the courts\u2019 decisions.\n\nOn 20 June 2005 and 26 July 2005 the Mardin Assize Court and the Ni\u011fde Assize Court, respectively, dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeals.

Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Okan Erdo\u011fan (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 20 October 2004. The applicant was represented by Mr M. N. Eldem, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 15 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1980 and lives in Kayseri, was a student at a military academy. At the time of his registration at this academy, his father had signed a promissory note for the reimbursement of the applicant\u2019s educational expenses in the event of his leaving the school, due to expulsion or otherwise.\n\nIn March 2003 the applicant was expelled from the military academy following a secret security investigation conducted by the Ministry of Defence into him and his family. The applicant was not notified of the specific reasons for his expulsion.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant asked the Supreme Military Administrative Court to annul the expulsion decision. During the proceedings, he did not have access to the classified documents and information submitted by the Ministry of Defence to the Supreme Military Administrative Court in support of its decision to expel him from the military academy.\n\nOn 10 December 2003 the Supreme Military Administrative Court refused to annul the expulsion decision. It stated that information and documents the confidentiality of which was required and necessitated for the performance of military service could not be disclosed to the applicant. The Court further emphasised that it was not bound by the classification made by the administration and that it made its own assessment as to whether the confidentiality of the documents was justified in each case. The written opinion submitted by the principal public prosecutor to the Supreme Military Administrative Court during the proceedings was not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 7 April 2004 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant\u2019s rectification request, which decision was served on the applicant on 20 April 2004.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence subsequently filed an action with the Kayseri Civil Court against the applicant for the reimbursement of his educational expenses. On 3 May 2004 the Kayseri Civil Court ordered the applicant to pay the Ministry of Defence 5,050,500,000 Turkish liras (TRL) (approximately 3,000 euros (EUR)), plus interest running from 8 April 2003.\n\nII. RELEVANT LAW\n\nA description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the decision of Karayi\u011fit v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 45874/05, 23 September 2008)."}

against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two German nationals, Mr Hans-Georg von Koester and Mr Hans-Konrad von Koester (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 8 November 2004.\n\nMr Hans-Georg von Koester is represented before the Court by the second applicant, Mr Hans-Konrad von Koester, who is a lawyer practising in Wiesbaden. The German Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicants alleged that the length of five sets of administrative proceedings and one set of official liability proceedings had been in breach of the reasonable time requirement laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 16 September 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the administrative and official liability proceedings to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1922 and 1957 respectively and live in Bonn and Wiesbaden.\n\n1. Background to the case\n\nThe first applicant was the owner of a plot of land with a landmarked house at the corner of Rheinstrasse, a main traffic artery with six lanes, and a square known as \u201cLuisenplatz\u201d in Wiesbaden. In 1983/84 that square was reshaped and an underground car park was built close to the first applicant's property. Between 1988 and 1993 several events and demonstrations took place on the square which caused noise. Furthermore several new road traffic regulations in Wiesbaden city resulted in an increased volume of traffic next to the first applicant's property. He therefore instituted several different sets of proceedings against the Wiesbaden local authorities.\n\nIn the end of 1995 the first applicant agreed before a notary to transfer the property to his son, the second applicant. In 1997 the second applicant was listed as the real estate's owner in the land register (Grundbuch). The first applicant was granted a right of enjoyment over his son's property (Nie\u00dfbrauch). The second applicant represented the first applicant throughout the proceedings before the German courts.\n\n2. Proceedings relating to noise remediation measures\n\n(a) Proceedings up to severance 8. On 29 April 1985 the second applicant asked the Wiesbaden trade supervision department (Gewerbeamt) to inform him whether there were plans to examine the influence of noise emissions on the first applicant's property. Between 1986 and 21 December 1990 the first applicant requested the Wiesbaden local authorities on several occasions to reimburse him the costs (notwendige Aufwendungen) incurred by him for noise remediation measures taken to protect him against noise caused by the construction works and, thereafter, the events and demonstrations carried out on Luisenplatz and by the increased volume of traffic. Furthermore he made official liability claims concerning his noise remediation measures and claimed damages for depreciation of his property. 9. On 2 April 1991 the first applicant lodged an action for failure to act (Unt\u00e4tigkeitsklage) with the Wiesbaden Administrative Court pursuant to section 75 of the Code of Administrative Court Procedures (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below) because the local authorities had not yet decided on his request of 21 December 1990. 10. On 4 June 1991 the Wiesbaden Administrative Court declared his action inadmissible. 11. On 14 August 1991 the first applicant appealed to the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal. 12. On 3 January 1992 he submitted a statement of grounds, which the Administrative Court of Appeal sent to the defendants on 7 January 1992. 13. On 12 July 1996 the Administrative Court of Appeal asked the parties whether they would waive an oral hearing and consent to a decision by a single judge. On 22 April 1997 and on 20 July 1997 they gave their consent. 14. On 24 February 1998 the Administrative Court of Appeal severed the official liability claims and the claim for damages in relation to the depreciation of the property and gave them a new file number (14 UE 794/98). (b) Reimbursement of costs of noise protection measures (no. 4 E 299/91) 15. By a judgment of 24 February 1998 the Administrative Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the Administrative Court of 4 June 1991 as to the reimbursement of costs for noise protection measures and referred the case to the Administrative Court for fresh consideration. 16. On 28 April 1998 the Administrative Court received the case files from the Administrative Court of Appeal. Between 14 May 1998 and 15 April 1999 it requested the first applicant on several occasions to make his submissions. 17. On 26 June 1999 the applicant informed the court that an extrajudicial settlement had been reached. On 1 September 1999 the court requested the parties to confirm that the case had been settled. After several further inquiries to the applicant as to whether the case had been settled, he made his submission on 30 March 2001. 18. On 10 December 2001 the Administrative Court held an oral hearing in which the question of the second applicant's third-party summons (Beiladung) was discussed. The sitting judge and the parties agreed that that summons was necessary. 19. On 11 December 2001 the Wiesbaden Administrative Court formally summoned the second applicant to participate in the proceedings as an interested third party. 20. By a judgment of 27 February 2002 the Administrative Court found for the applicants in part. That decision was served on the applicants on 12 and 13 March 2002. 21. On 10 April 2002 the applicants requested leave to appeal to the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal. 22. On 21 October 2002 the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal granted both applicants and the Wiesbaden local authorities leave to appeal. On 25 November 2002 the applicants submitted their statement of grounds for appeal. On 4 December 2002 the applicants received the defendant's statement of grounds together with the Administrative Court of Appeal's order to submit their reply to that statement by 6 January 2003. 23. On 20 December 2002 the applicants requested the Administrative Court of Appeal to extend the time-limit for further submissions, which it granted until 27 January 2003. The court declared that no further extensions could be granted. 24. On 26 March 2003, after holding an oral hearing on 18 March 2003, the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal quashed the Administrative Court's judgment and dismissed the action. 25. On 30 May 2003 the applicants requested leave to appeal on points of law from the Federal Administrative Court. 26. On 3 September 2003 the Federal Administrative Court refused to grant the applicants leave to appeal on points of law. 27. On 27 October 2003 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint, which the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit on 3 May 2004, without giving any reasons. 28. On 10 May 2004 that decision was served on the applicants. (c) Official liability proceedings (7 O 58/98) 29. On 26 March 1998 the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal found that the ordinary courts had been competent to decide on the compensation and official liability claims and referred them to the Wiesbaden Regional Court for adjudication. 30. Those proceedings were subsequently conducted by the Wiesbaden Regional Court under file number 7 O 58/98. 31. On 15 June 1998 the Regional Court requested the first applicant to pay the advance on the court fees which he did on 29 December 1999. 32. Between March 2000 and October 2000 the first applicant requested on several occasions extensions of the time-limits allowed for his submissions. 33. On 6 August 2001 the first applicant requested the court to stay the proceedings. 34. On 2 November 2002 he requested that a hearing scheduled by the Regional Court be postponed. 35. On 21 November 2002 the Regional Court stayed the proceedings at the first applicant's request until the termination of the administrative proceedings no. 4 E 299/91 before the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal. 36. On 10 October 2003 the Regional Court scheduled a hearing on 12 January 2004. On a request by the first applicant on 22 December 2003 the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 16 February 2004. As nobody appeared at the hearing on behalf of the applicant, the Regional Court issued a default judgment. Following an objection by the applicant the proceedings were continued. On 14 June 2004 a hearing was held during which the first applicant again requested that the proceedings be stayed on grounds of other pending administrative proceedings. 37. On 9 August 2004 the Regional Court rejected that request and scheduled a hearing on 22 November 2004. 38. On 11 April 2005 the Regional Court informed the applicants that the first applicant's numerous statements of claim (Klageantr\u00e4ge) had not been substantiated, as he had neither indicated the concrete reason nor the concrete object of his claims within the meaning of Article 253 \u00a7 2 no. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below). Accordingly, the court ordered him to formulate his statements in accordance with these formal requirements. Otherwise the court would declare them inadmissible. 39. On 23 December 2005 the first applicant submitted his statements of claim. 40. On 16 January 2006 the Regional Court held an oral hearing during which it ordered a purely written procedure after the parties had given their consent to it. The court ordered the parties to make their final submissions by 27 February 2006 and scheduled a hearing to pronounce its decision on 27 March 2006. The second applicant joined the proceedings as an interested third party. 41. On 24 March 2006 the Regional Court postponed the hearing for the pronouncement of its decision to 13 April 2006 on account of the complexity of the case. 42. On 15 May 2006 the Regional Court requested the parties to give their consent to the written procedure, as their initial consent given on 16 January 2006 had only been valid for three months (until 16 April 2006) according to section 128 \u00a7 2 sentence 3 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below). 43. On 26 July 2006 the Regional Court scheduled a hearing on 2 October 2006. 44. On 27 September 2006 the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 24 November 2006 as the applicants had not acknowledged receipt of their summons. 45. During the hearing of 24 November 2006 the defendant argued that the applicants had failed to substantiate their claims and requested to be allowed to make submissions in reply to the applicants' further submissions of 17, 23 and 24 November 2006. Therefore the court postponed the hearing to 19 January 2007 and fixed a time-limit for the defendant's submissions on 15 December 2006. 46. During the hearing held on 19 January 2007 the parties again discussed the question whether the applicant's claims had been sufficiently substantiated and the court informed the applicants that it was for them to substantiate and to prove the amount of the damages claimed. The court granted both parties the opportunity to make further submissions by 9 February 2007 and scheduled the date for the pronouncement of its judgment on 2 March 2007. Prior to the hearing the applicants made six further submissions. Therefore, the Regional Court postponed the hearing to 18 April 2007. 47. On 18 April 2007 the court again requested the parties to give their consent to the written procedure as the court was not able to decide the case within three months. 48. On 8 August 2007 the court requested the parties again to give their consent to the written procedure. As the applicants failed to respond, the court scheduled a hearing for 26 October 2007. However, on 25 October 2007 the applicants gave their consent and the court cancelled the hearing. 49. On 31 October 2007 the Regional Court authorised both parties to make further written submissions by 14 December 2007 and scheduled a hearing for the pronouncement of a decision for 18 January 2008. 50. On 18 January 2008 the court postponed the hearing to 22 February 2008 \u201cfor service-related reasons\u201d (aus dienstlichen Gr\u00fcnden). 51. On 20 February 2008 the Regional Court again requested the parties to give their consent to the written procedure, as it had overlooked that their consent of 25 October 2007 had only been valid until 25 January 2008, by which date the court would have had to pronounce its decision. Due to this procedural mistake the court cancelled the hearing scheduled on 22 February 2008 and requested the parties again to give their consent to the written procedure. After the court's further request of 31 March 2008 the applicants gave their consent on 14 April 2008. 52. On 21 April 2008 the Regional Court ordered the written procedure, granted the parties the opportunity to make submissions by 23 May 2008 and scheduled a hearing for the pronouncement of a decision on 11 July 2008. 53. On 11 July 2008 the Regional Court again informed the applicants (Hinweisbeschluss) that their statements of claim, which they had newly formulated and extended on several occasions, still failed to meet the formal requirements. It referred to its order of 11 April 2005 and concretised it by urging the applicants, inter alia, to substantiate their allegation that it was impossible for them to indicate the amount of damage caused by the alleged noise emissions. 54. That decision did not leave the Regional Court until 8 October 2008, when the court's registry provided the official copy of this decision with the court seal (Ausfertigungsvermerk). 55. On 13 March and 5 and 7 May 2009 the applicants made further submissions. 56. On 8 May 2009 the Regional Court held an oral hearing and scheduled a further hearing for the pronouncement of a judgment for 26 June 2009. 57. On 25 June and 24 July 2009 the Regional Court again postponed the hearing for the pronouncement of a judgment to 14 August 2009 on account of the complexity and difficulty of the case. 58. On 11 August 2009 the Regional Court again postponed the hearing and granted the defendant a further time-limit to make submissions by 28 August 2009. 59. These proceedings are still pending.\n\n3. Proceedings relating to various traffic regulations\n\n(a) Preliminary road closures (nos. 7 E 436/93(1) and 7 E 1208/99) i. Proceedings until severance 60. On 13 January 1992 the Wiesbaden local authorities ordered the preliminary closure of two streets, Friedrichstra\u00dfe (order no. 4/92) and Luisenstra\u00dfe (order no. 5/92). 61. On 20 February 1992 the first applicant lodged administrative appeals against both orders, and on 5 April 1993 he repeated his appeals. 62. On 28 May 1993 the first applicant lodged an action for failure to act with the Wiesbaden Administrative Court as the local authorities had not yet decided upon his administrative appeals of 20 February 1992 and 5 April 1993. 63. On 2 June 1993 the Administrative Court requested the authorities to submit their files. On 22 November 1993 it repeated its request. 64. On 6 January 1994 the defendant announced that they would submit their observations by the end of January 1994. On 11 February 1994 the court reminded the defendants to make their submissions. 65. On 22 February 1995 the Administrative Court inquired of the first applicant whether, in the light of the termination of a set of parallel pending proceedings for interim legal protection concerning the same legal issue, he wished to declare the proceedings disposed of. As the applicant failed to respond, the Administrative Court noted on 24 January 1997 that the proceedings were deemed to have been disposed of as the applicant had not pursued the proceedings for a period of more than six months. 66. On 8 April 1999 the first applicant declared that the proceedings had not entirely been disposed of. 67. On 2 September 1999 the Wiesbaden Administrative Court severed the proceedings concerning the preliminary closure of Luisenstra\u00dfe and pursued them under file number 7 E 1208/99. ii. Proceedings no. 7 E 436/93(1) 68. On 24 January 2000 the Administrative Court assigned the proceedings relating to the closure of Friedrichstra\u00dfe (file no. 7 E 436/93(1)) to a single judge. 69. On 28 January 2000 the second applicant was summoned to the proceedings as a third party. 70. On 23 February 2000 the applicants sought withdrawal of the judges of the Administrative Court sitting in their case for bias. On 20 April 2000 the applicants also sought withdrawal of the judge who was to decide on their bias challenge; the latter was rejected on 2 June 2000. 71. On 4 September 2000 the applicants were informed that the composition of the court had changed following an amendment to the courts' rules of procedure (Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung). 72. On 15 September 2000 the applicants also sought withdrawal of the new judges sitting in their case for bias. On 10 October 2000 the applicants requested an extension of the time-limit for submissions concerning the comments given by the challenged judges on their alleged bias (dienstliche Stellungnahme). On 8 November 2000 the applicants made their announced submissions. 73. On 5 and 14 February 2002 the challenged judges again commented on their alleged bias. 74. Between 28 March 2002 and 23 January 2003 the applicants repeatedly requested extensions of the time-limits allowed for making further submissions on their request for bias, which were all granted until 17 February 2003, when the applicants submitted their further reasons. 75. On 25 February 2003 the Administrative Court rejected the applicants' bias challenge of 15 September 2000 as an abuse of process. 76. The applicants' subsequent challenges for bias of 9 and 16 April 2003 were also rejected on 14 and 22 April 2003 for abuse of process. 77. By a judgment of 23 April 2003 the Administrative Court declared the action inadmissible. iii. Proceedings no. 7 E 1208/99 78. On 31 January 2000 the second applicant was summoned to the proceedings as a third party. 79. On 7 February 2002 the Administrative Court noted that the court files had been dispatched to several other chambers of the Administrative Court for consultation in connection with procedures related to objections on the grounds of bias lodged by the applicants in other proceedings. 80. On 12 December 2002 the rapporteur of the Administrative Court changed. 81. On 13 March 2003 the Administrative Court assigned the proceedings to a single judge. 82. On 9 and 16 April 2003 the applicants lodged two objections for bias, which were rejected on 14 and 22 April 2003. 83. By a judgment of 23 April 2003 the Administrative Court declared the action inadmissible. (b) Final road closures and installation of a parking meter (no. 7 E 320/99) 84. On 20 July 1994 the Wiesbaden local authorities ordered the final closure of parts of Luisenstrasse and of Friedrichstrasse to motor traffic. 85. On 12 September 1994 both applicants lodged an administrative appeal against that decision, arguing that the road closures resulted in increased traffic close to their property, which caused unbearable noise. 86. On 22 April 1998 the Wiesbaden local authorities ordered the installation of a parking meter (Parkautomat) in Luisenstrasse. 87. On 8 March 1999 the Darmstadt regional authorities dismissed an administrative appeal by the applicants against that decision by the local authorities. 88. On 12 April 1999 the applicants lodged an action with the Wiesbaden Administrative Court against the decisions of 22 April 1998 and 8 March 1999. Furthermore they lodged an action for failure to act because the local authorities had not yet decided upon their administrative appeal against the local authorities' decision of 20 July 1994. 89. On 4 February 2002 the Administrative Court noted that the court files had been dispatched to another chamber of the Administrative Court for consultation in respect of the proceedings no. 7 E 436/93. 90. On 25 February 2003 the parties were summoned to an oral hearing. 91. On 13 March 2003 the Administrative Court assigned the proceedings to a single judge. 92. On 10 and 16 April 2003 the applicants challenged the sitting judge for bias; these requests were dismissed on 14 and 22 April 2003. 93. On 23 April 2003 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicants' action. It found that the road closures had not resulted in a violation of the applicants' property rights. (c) Conversion of two streets into a pedestrian zone (no. 7 E 710/98) 94. On 7 September 1994 the Wiesbaden local authorities converted parts of Luisenstrasse and Friedrichsstrasse into a pedestrian area (Teileinziehungsverf\u00fcgungen). 95. On 12 September 1994 the first applicant lodged an administrative appeal against that decision. 96. On 13 June 1998 the first applicant lodged an action for failure to act as no decision had been taken on his administrative appeal of 12 September 1994. 97. On 7 June 1999 the second applicant was summoned to the proceedings as a third party. 98. On 4 February 2002 the rapporteur of the Administrative Court gave instructions that in the subsequent period the court file had been requested for consultation in other proceedings which the applicants were pursuing at the Administrative Court and in which decisions had to be taken regarding challenges for bias. 99. On 12 December 2002 the rapporteur of the Administrative Court changed. 100. On 25 February 2003 the parties were summoned to an oral hearing. On 13 March 2003 the Wiesbaden Administrative Court assigned the proceedings to a single judge. 101. On 9 and 16 April 2003 the applicants challenged the sitting judge for bias; these requests were dismissed on 14 and 22 April 2003. 102. On 23 April 2003 the Administrative Court dismissed the action. (d) Proceedings before the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal and before the Hessen Constitutional Court 103. On 4 June 2003 the applicants requested leave to appeal from the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal in respect of the proceedings nos. 7 E 436/93(1), 7 E 1208/99, 7 E 320/99, and 7 E 710/98. 104. On 30 January 2004 the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal refused to grant the applicants leave to appeal in respect of the proceedings no. 7 E 710/98. 105. On 2 February 2004 it refused to grant them leave to appeal concerning the proceedings nos. 7 E 436/93(1), 7 E 1208/99, 7 E 320/99. 106. On 5 March 2004 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint against the administrative courts' decisions rendered in the aforementioned proceedings with the Hessen Constitutional Court. Furthermore they accused Judge G. of that court of being biased, as he had acted as the judge in other proceedings involving the applicants at the Wiesbaden Administrative Court. 107. On 11 August 2004 the Hessen Constitutional Court dismissed their objections against Judge G. as being unfounded. 108. On 12 May 2005 the Hessen Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicants' constitutional complaint without giving any reasons. 109. On 23 May 2005 that decision was served on the applicants."}

25714/02 and 30383/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d). Application no. 74703/01 was submitted by ten applicants, namely Mr Abbas Baran, Mr Mehmet Bayram Ceylan, Mr Mehmet Cihat Ayd\u0131n, Mr M. Ali A\u011f\u0131n, Mr Mustafa Ya\u011fmur, Mr Hasan Bu\u011fa, Mr Fuat Albayrak, Mr Ahmet H\u00fcseyino\u011flu, Mr Enver Askan and Mr Hamdusela Ekinci. Application no. 74069/01 was submitted by co\u2011applicants Mr \u0130nayet \u00c7i\u00e7ek and Mr Necat \u00d6ztemel. The remainder of the applications were submitted by Mr Nusret Atl\u0131 (no. 76380/01), Mr Musa Narin (no. 16809/02), Mr \u015eaban Canpolat (no. 25710/02), Mr Mehmet Fikri Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m (no. 25714/02) and Mr Mehmet Salih K\u00f6mek\u00e7i (no. 30383/02).\n\nThe applicants were all represented by Mr Sedat \u00c7\u0131nar, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn various dates between 2003 and 2005, the Court decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants are all Turkish nationals who live in Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nIn May 1999 the applicants were laid off by the Diyarbak\u0131r Sur municipality, with which they had been employed.\n\nEach of the applicants brought an action in the Diyarbak\u0131r Labour Court, claiming outstanding salaries, dismissal indemnities, severance pays and other pecuniary rights.\n\nOn 11 November 1999 the court ruled in their favour and ordered the municipality to pay the following amounts in Turkish lira (TRL), including costs, together with interest running from June 1999: i. TRL 915,737,870 to Abbas Baran; ii. TLR 880,824,998 to Mehmet Bayram Ceylan0; iii. TLR 1,062,932,278 to M. Cihat Ayd\u0131n; iv. TLR 911,348,350 to M. Ali A\u011f\u0131n; v. TLR 1,111,150,000 to Mustafa Ya\u011fmur; vi. TLR 935,170,454 to Hasan Bu\u011fa; vii. TLR 833,474,812 to Fuat Albayrak; viii. TLR 1,078,451,254 to Ahmet H\u00fcseyino\u011flu; ix. TLR 1,021,383,958 to Enver Askan; x. TLR 905,829,494 to Hamdusela Ekinci; xi. TLR 1,000,000,000 to \u0130nayet \u00c7i\u00e7ek; xii. TRL 999,717,000 to Necat \u00d6ztemel; xiii. TRL 781,245,000 to Nusret Atl\u0131; xiv. TRL 1,111,150,000 to Musa Narin; xv. TRL 863,345,000 to \u015eaban Canpolat; xvi. TRL 27,113 to Mehmet Fikri Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m; and xvii. TRL 956,675,582 to Mehmet Salih K\u00f6mek\u00e7i.\n\nIn the absence of an appeal the judgments became final on 19 November 1999.\n\nWithin the following months, the applicants initiated enforcement proceedings in order to receive the due amounts. As their efforts proved fruitless, they requested the Diyarbak\u0131r Governorship to intervene to facilitate the enforcement of the court's judgments. The Governor's Office informed the applicants that they had requested the municipality to redress their grievances. However, the municipality did not make any payment since it was underfunded.\n\nAt the date of introduction of the current applications, the relevant judgment debts were still outstanding. However, in the meantime, friendly settlement agreements were reached between the following applicants and the municipality on the dates indicated: i. Abbas Baran on 17 January 2005; ii. Mustafa Ya\u011fmur on 25 December 2003; iii. Hasan Bu\u011fa on 28 December 2001; iv. Hamdusela Ekinci on 21 November 2005; v. \u0130nayet \u00c7i\u00e7ek on 11 December 2003; vi. Necat \u00d6ztemel on 23 December 2003; vii. Nusret Atl\u0131 on 21 November 2005; viii. Musa Narin on 20 May 2003; and ix. Mehmet Fikri Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m on 14 February 2002.\n\nNo settlement was reached with the other applicants. However, the municipality deposited certain partial amounts in the relevant account at the local enforcement office, which amounts were made available to some applicants and later paid.\n\nOn 9 November 2004 a settlement agreement was reached by the applicants' representative, Mr Sedat \u00c7\u0131nar, and the authorities. The agreement concerned the outstanding legal fees stemming from the labour courts' judgments. Mr \u00c7\u0131nar waived all of his rights and claims in connection with his representation of the applicants in the labour cases.\n\nOn 28 March 2005 Mehmet Salih K\u00f6mek\u00e7i, Ahmet H\u00fcseyino\u011flu and M. Cihat Ayd\u0131n initiated fresh claims against the municipality to recover their severance pay."}

Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr W. Ruci\u0144ski, on 6 August 2004.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 11 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Kielce.\n\nIn April 2002 the Kielce Regional Prosecutor ordered the applicant\u2019s house, car and premises used for commercial activities to be searched in view of the strong suspicion that he had been a member of a criminal group and had committed offences concerning property and documents.\n\nOn 28 May 2002 the applicant was arrested and on 29 May 2002 he was remanded in custody by the Kielce District Court on suspicion of forging documents, financial fraud and membership of a criminal gang. The court considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would tamper with evidence, given the fact that he had had close personal and business connections with several other persons charged with the same offences. On 17 June 2002 the Kielce Regional Court upheld the decision to detain him.\n\nIn decisions of 21 August and 22 November 2002 the Katowice District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention, holding that there was a contradiction between the applicant\u2019s statements and the evidence collected in the course of the proceedings. In addition, some documents had been forged and the prosecuting authorities could not yet identify all the perpetrators of the offences. The court made reference to the activities already carried out and gave a precise indication of the evidence that still had to be taken. Consequently, it decided that it was indispensable to separate the applicant from the other suspects and from the evidence which had not yet been secured. The court also relied on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the penalty he faced.\n\nOn 20 January 2003 the Kielce Regional Prosecutor extended the charges against the applicant.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was prolonged on 24 February 2003 by the Kielce District Court and subsequently by the Cracow Court of Appeal on 22 April 2003. The courts relied on the same grounds as previously invoked by the District Court. They pointed to the complexity of the case and the existence of a fear of collusion, given the applicant\u2019s role in the criminal gang and the considerable number of witnesses acquainted with the applicant who had yet to give evidence.\n\nOn 21 July 2003 a bill of indictment concerning 20 persons was filed with the Kielce District Court. The applicant was indicted on charges of multiple fraud, insurance fraud, misuse of property and membership of a criminal gang. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 254 witnesses and to obtain over 300 other pieces of evidence.\n\nOn 30 July 2003 the Kielce District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention until 30 October 2003, holding that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant and other defendants with whom he maintained close personal or business relations would tamper with evidence by inducing others to give false statements. On 28 August 2003 the Kielce Regional Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against that decision.\n\nOn 17 September and 17 November 2003 the Kielce District Court held hearings. Owing to the fact that many of the accused had entered into a plea bargain, the prosecutor filed a new bill of indictment and the hearings scheduled for 17, 18 and 19 November 2003 were adjourned until 17 December 2003 in order to give the accused the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the new bill.\n\nHearings were held on 17 December 2003, 19, 20, 21, 28 and 29 January, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 25 February, 15, 17, 22 and 24 March, 21 April, 19 May, 16 and 30 June, 14, 15, 21 (adjourned on an application by the accused) and 29 July (a hearing scheduled for 22 July was adjourned because the lawyer of one of the accused was absent), and 1, 6, 7, 8, 13 and 15 September 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, the applicant\u2019s detention was prolonged on 29 October 2003 and 28 January (an appeal by the applicant was dismissed on 11 February 2004), 24 March and 15 April 2004. The court relied on the fear of collusion stemming from the fact that many of the witnesses had not yet given evidence and that the members of the criminal group had maintained close relations. In particular, the court stressed that during the preparatory proceedings the defendants had illegally tried to contact each other. In its last decision the court also stated that the applicant and another defendant had twice lodged applications to adjourn the hearings at which it was to take evidence from the former co-accused, who possessed the greatest knowledge about the defendants\u2019 activities.\n\nOn 16 September 2004 the District Court made an application to the Cracow Court of Appeal under Article 263 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, requesting the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention beyond the statutory time-limit of 2 years. On 13 October 2004 the Court of Appeal prolonged his detention until 21 December 2004, partly allowing the application. The court stressed that the proceedings had almost been completed and that there was therefore no need to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention for the whole period requested. Its decision was upheld on 23 November 2004.\n\nA hearing scheduled for 18 October 2004 was adjourned until 19 October owing to the illness of one of the defendants. The hearing set down for 20 October 2004 had to be adjourned owing to the absence of a witness. It was held on 21 October 2004.\n\nFurther hearings were held on 10, 17 and 24 November 2004. The hearing scheduled for 29 November was adjourned at the request of one of the accused.\n\nOn 30 November 2004 the Kielce Regional Prosecutor filed another bill of indictment against the applicant and some of his co-defendants.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, the applicant lodged several unsuccessful applications for release from detention, which were dismissed on 23 July, 25 September and 31 October 2002, 17 December 2003, and 16 June and 1 September 2004.\n\nOn 8 December 2004 the Cracow Court of Appeal dismissed a second application by the District Court for the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention. The appellate court held that the District Court had failed to conclude the proceedings within the expected time-frame and that the applicant should not have to suffer the negative consequences of that fact. It further argued that the proceedings could be terminated in the course of the forthcoming hearings, given that there remained only one witness to be examined and that in the event of his absence his statements could be read out. On 15 October 2004 an appeal by the prosecutor against that decision was dismissed.\n\nHearings were held on 1, 15 and 20 December 2004.\n\nAt the hearing on 20 December 2004 the court decided to place the applicant under police supervision and to prohibit him from leaving the country.\n\nOn 28 July 2005 the Kielce District Court gave judgment, convicting the applicant and sentencing him to four years and six months\u2019 imprisonment for a total of 24 offences, most of them committed when acting within an organised criminal group."}

against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Bogus\u0142aw Kijowski (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 15 June 2007.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Z. Cicho\u0144, a lawyer practising in Krakow. The Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the domestic authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right to respect for his family life in respect of his two sons, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 12 October 2009 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 1). The President also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Krak\u00f3w.\n\nThe applicant married in 1996 and has two sons, A, born on 3 December 1996, and B, born on 4 February 2003.\n\nIn November 2002 the applicant's wife moved to her parents' house, taking A with her. One month later she instituted divorce proceedings. The applicant visited them on several occasions. However, most of these visits were disrupted by the couples' mutual hostility. In February 2003 the applicant's wife informed him that she would not allow further visits, but the applicant continued to go to her flat, sometimes with other members of his family.\n\nOn 3 August 2003 the applicant, during one of the visits, took his son A away with him, without his wife's consent and apparently by force. Afterwards A lived with the applicant in Krak\u00f3w until 8 March 2007.\n\nThe applicant submitted that A had been neglected and that he had acted in the best interests of his son. A subsequently received dental treatment, psychological support and speech therapy, and started going to school. The Government submitted that the child's psychological problems had been caused by the trauma of being kidnapped by his father, which had also led to the aggravation of his stutter. They relied on the reasoning of the Regional Court judgment of 30 June 2006 (see paragraph 16 below).\n\nIn August 2003 the applicant's wife informed the prosecutor that her son had been kidnapped by the applicant. The applicant's wife also applied to the court for sole residence of A; however, on 19 November 2003 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court decided to make a temporary residence order for A with the applicant. The applicant's wife was granted contact rights. The Government submitted that the applicant had been hindering her contact with A; the applicant denied this.\n\nIn May 2004 the parties and A were examined by experts from the RODK (Regional Family Consultation Centre). Their opinion was that A should live with his mother, although the applicant should enjoy extensive contact rights.\n\nOn 22 November 2004 the court changed its decision of 19 November 2003 and made a residence order for A with the applicant's wife. The applicant was granted contact rights and was ordered to return the child to his wife. An appeal by the applicant against this decision was dismissed on 22 March 2005.\n\nThe applicant failed to comply with this decision and refused to return A.\n\nOn 8 December 2004 the Brzesko District Court dismissed in the light of DNA tests the applicant's action contesting his paternity of B. Subsequently, the applicant attempted to visit B; however, his wife apparently hindered his contact with his younger son.\n\nThe applicant continued to live with A, who changed schools; they apparently moved house more than once. The applicant's wife complained to the prosecutor and attempted to have the decision of 22 November 2004 enforced.\n\nOn 30 June 2006 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court granted the applicant's petition for divorce. The court further decided to limit the applicant's parental responsibility for A and to deprive him altogether of parental responsibility for B. Residence of both children was ordered to be with the applicant's former wife. The court also allowed the applicant contact rights in respect of both his sons.\n\nAn appeal by the applicant against the judgment was dismissed on 28 December 2006 by the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal. The reasoned judgment was notified to the applicant on 15 February 2007.\n\nThe applicant's former wife made contact with B impossible for the applicant. However, he failed to institute enforcement proceedings against his former wife or to apply to the court for a fine to be imposed on her.\n\nOn 8 March 2007 the applicant was arrested by the police in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had kidnapped A and kept him, in spite of the final judgment of 30 June 2006 and the previous order of 22 November 2004. He remained in pre-trial detention for six months and was released in September 2007. On 25 May 2007 the applicant was indicted before the Krak\u00f3w District Court. Subsequently, the applicant and his mother were found guilty of keeping A with them, in breach of domestic decisions. On 4 December 2009 the Krakow Regional Court quashed that judgment. It appears that the proceedings are pending before the trial court.\n\nA was only returned to residence with his mother three months after the applicant's arrest, because between 8 March and 8 July 2007 he had been living with the applicant's mother.\n\nOn 25 January 2008 A was heard by the prosecutor in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The child stated that he preferred to live with his father and that his mother had been threatening him and had forbidden him to call his father.\n\nIn March 2008 A ran away from his mother's and went to his father's house, located 100 kilometres away. The applicant took him to the police station and A was returned to his mother.\n\nOn 1 April 2008 A ran away again and joined his father in Krak\u00f3w. They have been living together since then.\n\nOn 8 April 2008 the applicant applied to the D\u0105browa Tarnowska District Court for a new decision regarding parental responsibility and for an order for A's residence with him.\n\nOn 10 April 2008 the court guardian visited the applicant and A. According to her opinion, A did not want to live with his mother, had good living conditions with his father and paternal grandmother in Krak\u00f3w and preferred to stay with his father.\n\nOn 14 April 2008 the court dismissed the applicant's request for an interim order changing the child's place of residence (o zabezpieczenie wniosku).\n\nOn 23 June 2008 the Tarnow Regional Court made an interim order suspending contact between the applicant and B, which had been ordered in the divorce judgment of 30 June 2006.\n\nAt a hearing on 6 October 2008 the D\u0105browa Tarnowska District Court heard, inter alia, the director of A's former school, which he had been attending while living at his mother's. She testified that A had very often spoken to her complaining about his situation at home, in particular that his mother had prohibited him from visiting his father as well as from calling the applicant or using a computer for the purpose of contacting him. During the stay at his mother's the child apparently felt that he had been treated differently from his brother B and that his mother had threatened that he would be taken to a children's home and that his father would be arrested again.\n\nOn 6 October 2008 the court again dismissed the applicant's request for an interim order allowing A's place of residence to be with him. The court established that A had had de facto residence with the applicant between August 2003 and March 2007 and since April 2008. The child obviously had a stronger attachment to his father. However, the court did not consider that there was enough evidence to issue an interim order changing the earlier decision of A's place of residence before the case was ready for a decision on the merits.\n\nAt the hearing on 27 April 2009 the court heard A, who was then twelve years old, for the first time.\n\nOn the same date the court dismissed the applicant's request for the interim residence of A to be with him. The court again considered that without a thorough examination of the case it would not be possible to assess whether the best interests of the child required him to stay with his mother or with his father. Therefore the court decided to first hear experts and to obtain their opinion in order to establish the reasons for A's hostility towards his mother. An appeal by the applicant against this decision was dismissed on 20 July 2009.\n\nOn 11 August 2009 the D\u0105browa Gornicza District Court ordered an opinion to be prepared by the RODK. The opinion was finally submitted to the court on 16 December 2009. According to the experts the best interests of A required that the residence order be changed to allow A to live with the applicant. The experts took into account the feelings and choices made by A and the family situation characterised by a prolonged conflict between his parents, with A caught in the middle of that conflict. Nevertheless the experts noticed that A had been influenced by the applicant, who had enlisted him in a coalition against his mother and expected absolute loyalty from him. Such behaviour worked against the applicant's ability to be a good parent and violated the child's right to express his feelings freely and to form views about the family and the world on the basis of his own experience.\n\nOn 15 February 2010 the Krak\u00f3w District Court allowed the applicant's request of 8 April 2008, granted him full parental responsibility and ordered A's residence with him. It limited the parental responsibility of the applicant's former wife in respect of A. The court considered that A's negative attitude towards his mother, which manifested itself during the period when he was under her care in 2007, had been caused by the lengthy period of total deprivation of any contact between them and during which the applicant had isolated A from his mother. Moreover, for a prolonged period of time the applicant had the undisturbed opportunity to influence his child and create a very strong bond between them. Nevertheless, the court considered that the situation of the child had substantially changed since the divorce judgment of 30 June 2006. A had been living with the applicant, who has been securing his emotional and material needs. The court also took into account the wish of the child as to his preferred place of residence, given his age and level of maturity. Regard being had to the above, the court decided that the best interests of the child required the previous decisions to be modified and an order made for A's place of residence to be with the applicant.\n\nThe applicant's former wife appealed against the decision, but on 15 July 2010 the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court dismissed the appeal.\n\nOn 7 April 2010 the D\u0105browa Tarnowska District Court modified the judgment of 30 June 2006 and banned any contact between the applicant and his younger son B. The court found that the applicant had never wanted his second child, contested his paternity of him and had seen B only twice: once after B's birth in 2003 and once in connection with the preparation of a psychological opinion at the RODK. In consequence B, seven years old, had not developed any emotional ties with the applicant, and in fact was afraid of him and perceived him as a threat to the stability of his family. The court concluded that the best interests of the child required all contact between him and the applicant to cease.\n\nThe applicant appealed against this decision, but on 11 June 2010 the Dabrowa Tarnowska District Court rejected the appeal for failure to lodge it in accordance with formal requirements, namely by lodging it out of time. A further appeal against the latter decision was dismissed on 20 July 2010 by the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court."}

the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a German national, Mr J\u00fcrgen Schneider (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 June 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr J. Postlmayr, a lawyer practising in Mattighofen. The Austrian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The German Government did not make use of their right to intervene under Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn 7 November 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Stephanskirchen.\n\nOn 25 March 2000 the applicant, driving on the A1 motorway in the direction of Linz, was stopped by a traffic patrol. The officers noted that he had been driving at 200 km/h, thus exceeding the speed limit of 130 km/h by 70 km/h, and that he had kept driving in the left-hand lane, in breach of the Road Traffic Act. Furthermore, they observed that, despite the good visibility, the applicant had switched on his fog-lights, and that he had failed to present his driving licence when they had requested him to do so.\n\nSubsequently, on 27 April 2000 the Amstetten District Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) requested the applicant to comment on the above charges.\n\nOn 15 May 2000 the applicant filed his defence. He stated that he had been in a rush, since his passenger was sick and he wanted to take him home as fast as possible. Furthermore, he claimed that he had been driving at a maximum of 160 km/h. In addition, he submitted that he had been constantly overtaking cars, which was why he had been driving in the left-hand lane. The applicant contended that he had not used any fog-lights.\n\nIn a decision of 5 October 2000 the Amstetten District Authority convicted the applicant of four traffic offences, namely speeding, breaching the requirement to drive in the right-hand lane, unjustified use of fog-lights and failure to carry his driving licence with him, and imposed fines amounting in total to 7,000 Austrian schillings (508.71 euros) on him, with 236 hours\u2019 imprisonment in default. Moreover, it ordered him to pay procedural costs.\n\nRepeating his defence, the applicant, on 2 November 2000, lodged an appeal as regards the first three offences with the Lower Austria Independent Administrative Panel (Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat). He did not appeal against his conviction for failure to carry a driving licence with him. He did not request a hearing.\n\nOn 28 May 2001 the Independent Administrative Panel, sitting in camera, dismissed the appeal. It stated that two police officers had been following the applicant over a stretch of more than 1,000 metres and had made consistent statements on the event.\n\nOn 24 July 2001 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). He alleged in particular that the Independent Administrative Panel had failed to hold a hearing. This would have allowed it to examine his passenger and the police officers and, if need be, to obtain an expert opinion. Furthermore he repeated his defence as regards the charges of speeding and driving in the left-hand lane. As to the alleged use of fog-lights, the applicant presumed that they had possibly been mixed up with his xenon lamps.\n\nAt the Administrative Court\u2019s request, the applicant submitted a second copy of his complaint on 14 August 2001.\n\nOn 20 November 2001 the Independent Administrative Panel filed its observations on the case. It stated that the applicant had failed to request a hearing. Nor had he applied for the examination of a witness or the production of an expert opinion.\n\nOn 16 January 2002, the applicant supplemented his complaint. He asserted, in particular, that an oral hearing had to be held even if he had not expressly requested one.\n\nIn an order of 29 January 2002 the Independent Administrative Panel was requested to submit the file. On 27 February 2002 it informed the Administrative Court that the file was missing. At the same time it submitted a statement in reply. The applicant made further submissions on 19 March 2002.\n\nOn 23 July 2004 the Administrative Court partly quashed the Independent Administrative Panel\u2019s decision. It (a) upheld the conviction as regards speeding but quashed the sentence relating to this offence; (b) quashed the conviction and sentence as to the unjustified use of broad-beam lamps; and (c) refused to deal with the complaint relating to the conviction for breaching the requirement to drive in the right-hand lane pursuant to section 33a of the Administrative Court Act. In respect of the first two offences the Administrative Court remitted the case to the Independent Administrative Panel, holding that the latter was obliged to hold a hearing, since none of the exceptions set out in section 51e of the Administrative Offences Act (Verwaltungsstrafgesetz), which regulates the question of oral hearings, had been present. The Administrative Court\u2019s judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 24 August 2004.\n\nOn 7 September 2004 the Independent Administrative Panel issued a summons for a hearing on 30 September 2004.\n\nOn that date the Independent Administrative Panel heard the two police officers as witnesses. The applicant had asked to be excused.\n\nOn 3 November 2004, following a further excuse by the applicant\u2019s counsel, the Independent Administrative Panel scheduled another hearing for 29 November 2004.\n\nIn a letter of 26 November 2004 counsel notified the Independent Administrative Panel that, since he was unable to contact the applicant, neither he nor his client would attend the hearing. The hearing was held on 29 November 2004 in the absence of the defence.\n\nOn 13 December 2004 the Independent Administrative Panel dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. The decision was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 30 December 2004.\n\nThe applicant did not lodge a complaint with the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court."}

case originated in two applications (nos. 16231/06 and 4890/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Hakan Y\u0131lmaz and Mr Taner Zabun (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 3 April 2006 and 15 January 2008, respectively.\n\nThe first applicant was represented by Mr H. \u0130\u015fler, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The second applicant was represented by Mr A. Okat, a lawyer practising in K\u00fctahya. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 May 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nThe applicants were born in 1980 and 1975, respectively, and live in Ankara and K\u00fctahya.\n\nThe first applicant lost the sight of his right eye and the second applicant was injured in the legs during their compulsory military service. Upon the refusal of the Retirement Fund (Emekli Sand\u0131\u011f\u0131) to grant them special disability benefits, they applied to the Supreme Military Administrative Court, separately, for annulment of the Retirement Fund's decisions.\n\nOn 6 October 2005 and 5 April 2007, respectively, the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected their requests. In delivering its decision in respect of the first applicant, the Supreme Military Administrative Court relied on an old expert report which it had obtained during an action for damages filed previously by the applicant regarding the same disability. The written opinions submitted by the principal public prosecutor to the Supreme Military Administrative Court regarding their cases were not communicated to the applicants.\n\nThe applicants' requests for rectification were rejected by the Supreme Military Administrative Court on 15 December 2005 and 5 July 2007, respectively. The decision of 5 July 2007 was served on the second applicant on 17 July 2007."}

The applicants\u2019 application to the Court referred to Article 48 as amended by Protocol No. 90, which Austria had ratified. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 4 thereof read in conjunction with Rule 100 \u00a7 1 and Rule 24 \u00a7 6 of the Rules of Court, a Panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 14 January 1999 that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Third Section. The Chamber ultimately constituted within the Section included Mr. J.-P. Costa, Mr P. K\u016bris, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr K. Jungwiert, Mrs H.S. Greve and Mr K. Traja.\n\nOn 12 March 1999 the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues of the case. By letter of 29 April 1999 the applicants informed the Court that they did not wish to submit a memorial; on 17 May 1999 the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of the case.\n\nAfter consulting the Agent of the Government and applicants\u2019 lawyer the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing in the case.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants' farm was the object of land consolidation proceedings (Zusammenlegungsverfahren) instituted by the Gmunden District Agricultural Authority (Agrarbezirksbeh\u00f6rde) on 22 February 1973.\n\nOn 21 August 1984 the District Authority held a hearing at which the farmers concerned could express their wishes (Wunschverhandlung) and on 22 August 1985 the District Authority ordered the provisional transfer of the properties concerned, inter alia, land owned by the applicants. In July 1989 the District Authority issued a consolidation plan (Zusammenlegungsplan). The applicants appealed, claiming that they had not received adequate land in exchange for their parcels AK 2 and AK 8. On 5 July 1990 the Upper Austria Regional Land Reform Board (Landesagrarsenat) dismissed the applicants' appeal after an oral hearing held in private, but in the presence of the parties and their lawyer.\n\nOn 25 September 1990 the applicants filed a complaint with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) against the above decision. They also asked the Court to hold an oral hearing.\n\nOn 15 December 1992 the Administrative Court dismissed the complaint, rejecting at the same time, in accordance with Section 39 (2) no. 6 of the Administrative Court Act, the applicants' request for an oral hearing."}

application (no. 16637/07) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Ms Aysel Aydin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 April 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. Hilbrans, a lawyer practising in Berlin. The German Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that her criminal conviction violated her right to freedom of expression.\n\nOn 30 November 2009 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1). Having been informed of the case by a letter of 3 December 2010, the Turkish Government did not express any wish to intervene under Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Wuppertal. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\n1. Background to the case\n\nOn 22 November 1993 the German Interior Ministry issued a decision by which it imposed a ban on the activities of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (\u201cthe PKK\u201d), under Article 18, second sentence, of the Law on Associations (Vereinsgesetz, see Relevant domestic law, below).\n\nRelevant parts of the decision read as follows: \u201c1. The activities pursued by the \u201cWorkers' Party of Kurdistan\u201d (PKK)...run contrary to provisions of the criminal law, are directed against the concept of international understanding, endanger inner security and other important interests of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe \u201cWorkers' Party of Kurdistan\u201d (PKK)...is not allowed to pursue its activities within the territorial ambit of the Law on Associations.\u201d\n\nAs the PKK as such did not challenge the imposition of the ban before the German courts, the decision became final on 26 March 1994.\n\nFollowing the arrest of its leader, Abdullah \u00d6calan, in 1999, the PKK's executives changed their strategy and declared an end to the armed battle against Turkish army entities. Following a \u201cpeace initiative\u201d declared by the party's seventh congress on 17 January 2000, the PKK did not organise any further demonstrations or violent acts in Germany.\n\nIn 2001 the PKK's presidential counsel decided to launch a large-scale campaign, during which their supporters should address themselves to the German authorities, should acknowledge their support for the PKK and should demand that the ban on the PKK's activities be lifted.\n\nThe supporters signed a declaration. The declarations were then collected and handed over in large numbers to parliaments, administrative bodies and courts. The content of the largely identical declarations was as follows: \u201cSelf declaration (Selbsterkl\u00e4rung) \u201cI also am a follower of the PKK\u201d (\u201cAuch ich bin ein PKK'ler\u201d) As the Kurdish people has been denied its basic right to life, it has had no choice but to take up arms. After twenty years of war, our national leader, Abdullah \u00d6calan, has initiated a strategic change. For two years the PKK has been using exclusively political means to fight for a peaceful and democratic solution to the Kurdish question. On the basis of this new strategy the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK) is undergoing a global reformation. Strongly determined to find a solution, it has developed its political activities against all resistance without leaving the framework of legality. Although the Kurdish question emerged geographically in the Middle East, having regard to its historical, political and international connections it is a European problem waiting for a solution. Europe played a major role in the setting of Middle Eastern boundaries. That is why Europe is now confronted with the task of playing a role in the solution of the problems. Just as it failed to offer a prospect of a solution when our leader was abducted in the framework of an international conspiracy, Europe fails today to make use of the opportunities offered by the PKK. While the majority of the European Member States make Turkey's accession to the European Union dependent on the Copenhagen criteria, they deny the national and political status of the Kurds living in Europe. Germany and England, in particular, insist on a policy of bans. With this destructive attitude Europe puts itself within the context of the policy of destruction and negation which is directed against the Kurdish people. Today as in the past Europe continues its negative tradition. This is nothing but a policy of double moral standards.\n\nOn this basis I, as a member of the Kurdish people, declare that I share the PKK's new policy, which, for two years, has been leading its political fight on a legal basis. I further declare that I belong to the PKK.\n\nI challenge the European Member States to apply the same standards to themselves they apply to non-member States. I furthermore request these States to comply themselves with the express criteria for accession to the European Union with regard to the Kurds living in Europe. I therefore demand the full recognition of the rights granted to other peoples for the Kurdish people.\n\nI further demand the official recognition of the cultural and political values created by the Kurdish people in the course of their great struggle. In this context I demand respect for my people's national and political identity.\n\nI support the line of the PKK's democratic struggle, as has been confirmed by its seventh congress. Having regard to the fact that the PKK has not committed one single violent act for two years, I demand the lifting of all bans which are applied on the PKK.\n\nI further declare that the liberty of our leader, Abdullah \u00d6calan, and the possibility of his political activity are the only guarantee for an enduring solution. I therefore demand: \u201cFreedom for Abdullah \u00d6calan \u2013 Peace in Kurdistan\u201d. I hereby declare that I most severely condemn the prohibition issued against the PKK and the criminal prosecution of PKK membership and of active sympathy for the PKK. I further declare that I do not acknowledge this prohibition and that I assume all responsibility arising therefrom.\u201d\n\n2. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nWith others, the applicant organised and coordinated a collection of signatures of the declaration in Berlin. She also signed a declaration herself. On 16 July 2001 the applicant, with two others, handed two folders containing 467 signed declarations to the Berlin public prosecutor. On 24 September 2001 the applicant handed over one further folder containing declarations. Furthermore, the applicant donated certain sums of money to a sub-organisation of the PKK, which was also subject to the ban.\n\nWithin the framework of the campaign, more than 4,000 declarations were handed to the authorities in Berlin; approximately 100,000 declarations were submitted to German administration as a whole.\n\nOn 17 July 2003 the Berlin Regional Court (Landgericht) convicted the applicant of contravening a ban imposed on an association's activity (section 20 \u00a7 1 no. 4 in conjunction with section 18, second sentence, of the Law on Associations) and sentenced her to 150 daily fines of eight euros each. During the hearing before that court, the applicant submitted a declaration that she had not intended to breach the criminal law, but to express her opinion and to further the understanding between the German and the Kurdish people. The Regional Court considered that the applicant, by signing the declaration, taking part in the campaign and giving donations, had flouted the ban on pursuing the PKK's activities.\n\nThe Regional Court considered that the declaration's content, seen in the context of the accompanying campaign, was likely to have a positive effect on the association's unlawful activities. The Regional Court considered, in particular, that the declaration \u201cnot (to) acknowledge this ban and (to) assume all responsibility arising therefrom\u201d had a twofold effect: Firstly, the applicant expressed her commitment not to abide by the ban in the future and thus to provide the PKK with security for planning further unlawful activities. Secondly, it was likely to strengthen solidarity with other potential supporters.\n\nAccording to the Regional Court, the declaration signed by the applicant was not covered by her right to freedom of expression, as the applicant did not confine herself to claiming freedom and self-determination for the Kurdish people, to demand the lifting of the ban on the PKK and most severely to condemn its continuation, which would fall within the ambit of the applicant's freedom of expression. Seen in the context of the aims of the overall campaign, the declaration also contained the statement that the applicant would continue to support the PKK even if the ban imposed on its activities was not lifted. This was already implied in the concluding statement, that the applicant would \u201cassume all responsibility arising therefrom\u201d, that is to say from any flouting of the ban. The Regional Court also considered that the campaign had the further aim of overburdening the public prosecution service with such a large number of criminal proceedings that they would not be able to cope.\n\nThe Regional Court considered as mitigating factors, inter alia, the importance of the right to freedom of expression.\n\nOn 15 January 2004 the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), referring to its own pilot judgment given on 27 March 2003 (see relevant domestic law and practice, below), dismissed the applicant's appeal on points of law. According to that court, the Regional Court's interpretation of the applicant's statement and the evaluation of her behaviour were compatible with the right to freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 5 of the Basic Law. Having regard to the context and the circumstances of the case, the Regional Court had comprehensively and coherently refuted the applicant's allegations that she had not participated in a campaign which had been organised by the PKK with the aim to hamper the criminal prosecution of breaches of the ban by provoking a massive quantity of criminal investigations, but that she had merely intended to express her opinion on the ban. This was demonstrated by the fact that the applicant and the other campaigners did not address themselves to the Federal Interior Ministry, which would have been competent for lifting the ban, but addressed a massive quantity of collected individually signed declarations to the public prosecutor's office. The applicant's unwillingness to abide by the ban was further demonstrated by the fact that she had been previously convicted of a similar offence and that she had flouted the ban in another, separate way by financially supporting a sub-organisation of the PKK.\n\nThe Federal Court of Justice finally considered that the Regional Court had sufficiently weighted the importance of the right to freedom of expression when assessing the sentence.\n\nOn 20 March 2004 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which she complained that her right to freedom of expression and her right to petition had been violated.\n\nOn 26 September 2006 the Federal Constitutional (Bundesverfassungsgericht), in a reasoned decision of 21 pages, refused to accept the applicant's complaint for adjudication as being unfounded.\n\nThe Federal Constitutional Court held that the applicant's statements fell within the ambit of her right to freedom of expression under Article 5 of the Basic Law. It considered, however, that her conviction was justified under paragraph 2 of that same Article as being based on a general law. The Federal Constitutional Court considered, at the outset, that the activities of an association could only be banned if it generally and continuously pursued dangerous aims, which was established by the enforceable ban issued by the Interior Ministry. Section 20 \u00a7 1 no. 4 of the Law on Association was not directed against the expression of an opinion as such, but only against the purposeful support it lent to the association's activity which had been prohibited in the interest of protecting the democratic state based on the rule of law. An individual person who pursued his own political aims was not concerned; he was merely prevented from doing so by supporting the activities of a prohibited association.\n\nIt followed that only such behaviour was subject to criminal liability, which was relevant with regard to the purpose of the banning order. Furthermore, the behaviour had to be related to the association's activity. Art. 5 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law had not to cede already where someone advocated the same opinions as the organisation affected by the ban; it did have to cede, however, if an unbiased observer gained the impression that this was an action which was directly related to the association. The necessary relation to the purpose of the banning order was lacking where statements of opinions worked towards a lift of a ban of activities, which was protected by the right to freedom of expression in the interest of the openness of the democratic process.\n\nIn the context of the criminal courts' examination of whether the constituent elements of an offence exist, freedom of opinion took second place without a weighing being required in the individual case, notwithstanding individual weighing that was necessary on other levels, for instance as regarded the fixing of the fine. The only decisive question was whether the above-mentioned criteria had been met.\n\nWith regard to the application of these principles in the instant case, the Federal Constitutional Court found as follows: (a) The courts answered the question of whether the self-declarations bore sufficient relation to the association's activity in the affirmative. According to the facts established by the lower courts, which are constitutionally unobjectionable, the declarations were made in the context of a mass campaign initiated and steered by the PKK leadership, which was carried out Germany-wide and attracted considerable public attention. The campaign was preceded by large-scale advertising, the content of the declaration was discussed among Kurdish compatriots, and the letters were collected and submitted, sometimes in the course of demonstrations. The headline and the text of the declaration itself (\u201cI am also a follower of the PKK\u201d, \u201cI further declare that I belong to the PKK\u201d) also made it possible for the courts to infer, in a constitutionally unobjectionable manner, a sufficient relation precisely to the PKK as the organisation affected from the ban on activities. (b) The courts observed the principles established by the Federal Court of Justice in its judgment dated 27 March 2003, that the self declarations would nevertheless have been exempt from criminal liability as expressions of the right to freedom of expression if they had restricted themselves to demanding freedom and self-determination for the Kurdish people, to calling for a lift of the ban on the PKK's activities and severely condemning the maintenance of that ban. The right to freedom of expression includes the right to assert one's opinion as effectively as possible. The effect of a strengthening of solidarity that goes along with a support of the lift of the ban is to be tolerated in the interest of the free expression of opinion even if it is at the same time an expression of sympathy for the banned association. The courts, however, assumed in a constitutionally unobjectionable manner that the self-declarations in favour of the PKK transgressed the boundaries, thus determined, of declarations of solidarity and sympathy in favour of an association affected by a ban on activities to the extent that they had to be understood as a commitment made by those signing it not to respect the ban on activities in the future and not to be deterred from contravening the ban even by the threat of criminal sanctions. The courts could assume without misjudging freedom of opinion that such a declaration of willingness to break the law that was made in the context of a mass campaign complied with the constituent element of the offence in question.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Constitutional Court further considered that the criminal conviction did not violate the applicant's right to petition as enshrined in the Basic Law.\n\nThis decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 16 October 2006."}

European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ali B\u00fclent Sar\u0131ta\u00e7 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 21 November 1995.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs Semra Dural Esim, a lawyer practising in Mu\u011fla (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr R\u0131za T\u00fcrmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaint (applications nos. 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32964/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 \u00a7 2).\n\nBy a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties\u2019 observations, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1)\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Arrest and detention of the applicant\n\nOn 15 June 1979 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the THKP-C (Turkish People\u2019s Liberation Party/Front).\n\nOn 11 July 1979 the applicant was detained on remand.\n\nB. Trial in the Istanbul Martial Law Court\n\nOn 15 January 1980 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant and 127 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation, namely the THKP/C, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. He further charged the applicant with having been involved in a number of crimes such as armed robbery of public and private properties, and opening fire on several individuals.\n\nThe prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 30 July and 17 October 1980, 24 March 1981 and 23 February 1982 in respect of additional criminal proceedings initiated against the applicant before the Zonguldak, Torba and Izmir Assize Courts (a\u011f\u0131r ceza mahkemesi), the courts issued decisions of non\u2011jurisdiction on the ground that the incidents fell within the jurisdiction of the Martial Courts. The cases were joined to the case-file before the \u0130stanbul Martial Court.\n\nIn a judgment of 8 November 1984 the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the THKP/C and his involvement in the alleged crimes. It sentenced the applicant to death penalty under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code.\n\nC. Proceedings on appeal\n\nAs the applicant\u2019s sentence exceeded 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, his case was automatically referred to the Military Court of Cassation (Askeri Yarg\u0131tay).\n\nOn 12 April 1988 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court failed to establish the applicant\u2019s involvement in some of the alleged crimes. It referred the case to the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court.\n\nOn 17 August 1990 the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment, permanently debarred him from employment in the civil service and placed him under judicial guardianship. The applicant appealed.\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (Yarg\u0131tay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 4 January 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.\n\nOn 18 April 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction."}

Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter called \u201cthe Government\u201c). The case has its origin in an application against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (hereinafter called \u201cthe Commission\u201c) under Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Convention\u201c), by a United Kingdom citizen, Mr. Sidney Elmer Golder. The application was first submitted in 1969; it was supplemented in April 1970 and registered under no. 4451/70. The Commission\u2019s report in the case, drawn up in accordance with Article 31 (art. 31) of the Convention, was transmitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 5 July 1973.\n\nThe Government\u2019s application, which was made under Article 48 (art. 48) of the Convention, was lodged with the registry of the Court on 27 September 1973 within the period of three months laid down in Articles 32 para. 1 and 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47). The purpose of the application is to submit the case for judgment by the Court. The Government therein express their disagreement with the opinion stated by the Commission in their report and with the Commission\u2019s approach to the interpretation of the Convention.\n\nOn 4 October 1973, the Registrar received from the Secretary of the Commission twenty-five copies of their report.\n\nOn 9 October 1973, the then President of the Court drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of five of the seven judges called upon to sit as members of the Chamber, Sir Humphrey Waldock, the elected judge of British nationality, and Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri, Vice-President of the Court, being ex officio members under Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 3 (b) of the Rules of Court respectively. The five judges chosen were MM. R. Cassin, R. Rodenbourg, A. Favre, T. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson and W. Ganshof van der Meersch, (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). The President also drew by lot the names of substitute judges (Rule 2l para. 4). Mr. G. Balladore Pallieri assumed the office of President of the Chamber in accordance with Rule 21 para. 5.\n\nThe President of the Chamber ascertained, through the Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and of the Delegates of the Commission on the procedure to be followed. By Order of 12 October 1973, he decided that the Government should file a memorial within a time-limit expiring on 3l January 1974 and that the Delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of the receipt of the Government\u2019s memorial. The President of the Chamber also instructed the Registrar to request the Delegates to communicate to the Court the main documents listed in the report. These documents were received at the registry on 17 October. The President later granted extensions of the times allowed, until 6 March 1974 for the Agent of the Government, and until 6 June and then 26 July for the Delegates (Orders of 21 January, 9 April and 5 June 1974). The Government\u2019s memorial was received at the registry on 6 March 1974 and that of the Commission - with observations by the applicant\u2019s counsel annexed - on 26 July.\n\nThe Chamber met in private on 7 May 1974. Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, who had been elected a member of the Court in January 1974 in place of Sir Humphrey Waldock, took his seat in the Court as the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 2 para. 3) (art. 43). On the same day the Chamber, \u201cconsidering that the case raise(d) serious questions affecting the interpretation of the Convention\u201c, decided under Rule 48 to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court. The new President of the Court, Mr. Balladore Pallieri, assumed the office of President.\n\nAfter consulting the Agent of the Government and the Delegates of the Commission, the President decided, by Order of 6 August 1974, that the oral hearings should open on 11 October.\n\nThe public hearings took place on 11 and 12 October 1974 in the Human Rights Building at Strasbourg. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government: Mr. P. Fifoot, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Barrister-at-Law, Agent and Counsel, Sir Francis Vallat, K.C.M.G., Q.C., Professor of International Law, King\u2019s College, London; formerly Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, Mr. G. Slynn, Q.C., Recorder of Hereford, Counsel, and Sir William Dale, K.C.M.G., formerly Legal Adviser to the Commonwealth Office, Mr. R. M. Morris, Principal, Home Office, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission: Mr. G. Sperduti, Principal Delegate, MM. T. Opsahl and K. Mangan, Delegates, and Mr. N. Tapp, Q.C., who had represented the applicant before the Commission, assisting the Delegates under Rule 29 para. 1, second sentence. The Court heard the addresses and submissions of Mr. Fifoot, Sir Francis Vallat and Mr. Slynn for the Government and of Mr. Sperduti, Mr. Opsahl and Mr. Tapp for the Commission, as well as their replies to questions put by the Court and by several judges. At the hearings, the Government produced certain documents to the Court\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nThe facts of the case may be summarised as follows.\n\nIn 1965, Mr. Sidney Elmer Golder, a United Kingdom citizen born in 1923, was convicted in the United Kingdom of robbery with violence and was sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. In 1969, Golder was serving his sentence in Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight.\n\nOn the evening of 24 October 1969, a serious disturbance occurred in a recreation area of the prison where Golder happened to be. On 25 October, a prison officer, Mr. Laird, who had taken part and been injured in quelling the disturbance, made a statement identifying his assailants, in the course of which he declared: \u201cFrazer was screaming ... and Frape, Noonan and another prisoner whom I know by sight, I think his name is Golder ... were swinging vicious blows at me.\u201c\n\nOn 26 October Golder, together with other prisoners suspected of having participated in the disturbance, was segregated from the main body of prisoners. On 28 and 30 October, Golder was interviewed by police officers. At the second of these interviews he was informed that it had been alleged that he had assaulted a prison officer; he was warned that \u201cthe facts would be reported in order that consideration could be given whether or not he would be prosecuted for assaulting a prison officer causing bodily harm\u201c.\n\nGolder wrote to his Member of Parliament on 25 October and 1 November, and to a Chief Constable on 4 November 1969, about the disturbance of 24 October and the ensuing hardships it had entailed for him; the prison governor stopped these letters since Golder had failed to raise the subject-matter thereof through the authorised channels beforehand.\n\nIn a second statement, made on 5 November 1969, Laird qualified as follows what he had said earlier: \u201cWhen I mentioned the prisoner Golder, I said \u2018I think it was Golder\u2019, who was present with Frazer, Frape and Noonan, when the three latter were attacking me. \u201cIf it was Golder and I certainly remember seeing him in the immediate group who were screaming abuse and generally making a nuisance of themselves, I am not certain that he made an attack on me. \u201cLater when Noonan and Frape grabbed me, Frazer was also present but I cannot remember who the other inmate was, but there were several there one of whom stood out in particular but I cannot put a name to him.\u201c On 7 November, another prison officer reported that: \u201c... during the riot of that night I spent the majority of the time in the T.V. room with the prisoners who were not participating in the disturbance. 740007, Golder was in this room with me and to the best of my knowledge took no part in the riot. His presence with me can be borne out by officer ... who observed us both from the outside.\u201c Golder was returned to his ordinary cell the same day. l5. Meanwhile, the prison authorities had been considering the various statements, and on 10 November prepared a list of charges which might be preferred against prisoners, including Golder, for offences against prison discipline. Entries relating thereto were made in Golder\u2019s prison record. No such charge was eventually preferred against him and the entries in his prison record were marked \u201ccharges not proceeded with\u201c. Those entries were expunged from the prison record in 1971 during the examination of the applicant\u2019s case by the Commission.\n\nOn 20 March 1970, Golder addressed a petition to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, that is, the Home Secretary. He requested a transfer to some other prison and added: \u201cI understand that a statement wrongly accusing me of participation in the events of 24th October last, made by Officer Laird, is lodged in my prison record. I suspect that it is this wrong statement that has recently prevented my being recommended by the local parole board for parole. \u201cI would respectfully request permission to consult a solicitor with a view to taking civil action for libel in respect of this statement .... Alternatively, I would request that an independent examination of my record be allowed by Mrs. G.M. Bishop who is magistrate. I would accept her assurance that this statement is not part of my record and be willing to accept then that the libel against me has not materially harmed me except for the two weeks I spent in the separate cells and so civil action would not be then necessary, providing that an apology was given to me for the libel ....\u201c\n\nIn England the matter of contacts of convicted prisoners with persons outside their place of detention is governed by the Prison Act 1952, as amended and subordinate legislation made under that Act. Section 47, sub-section I, of the Prison Act provides that \u201cthe Secretary of State may make rules for the regulation and management of prisoners ... and for the ... treatment ... discipline and control of persons required to be detained ....\u201c The rules made by the Home Secretary in the exercise of this power are the Prison Rules 1964, which were laid before Parliament and have the status of a Statutory Instrument. The relevant provisions concerning communications between prisoners and persons outside prison are contained in Rules 33, 34 and 37 as follows: \u201cLetters and visits generally Rule 33 (1) The Secretary of State may, with a view to securing discipline and good order or the prevention of crime in the interests of any persons, impose restrictions, either generally or in a particular case, upon the communications to be permitted between a prisoner and other persons. (2) Except as provided by statute or these Rules, a prisoner shall not be permitted to communicate with any outside person, or that person with him, without the leave of the Secretary of State. ... Personal letters and visits Rule 34 ... (8) A prisoner shall not be entitled under this Rule to communicate with any person in connection with any legal or other business, or with any person other than a relative or friend, except with the leave of the Secretary of State. ... Legal advisers Rule 37 (1) The legal adviser of a prisoner in any legal proceedings, civil or criminal, to which the prisoner is a party shall be afforded reasonable facilities for interviewing him in connection with those proceedings, and may do so out of hearing but in the sight of an officer. (2) A prisoner\u2019s legal adviser may, with the leave of the Secretary of State, interview the prisoner in connection with any other legal business in the sight and hearing of an officer.\u201c\n\nOn 6 April 1970, the Home Office directed the prison governor to notify Golder of the reply to his petition of 20 March as follows: \u201cThe Secretary of State has fully considered your petition but is not prepared to grant your request for transfer, nor can he find grounds for taking any action in regard to the other matters raised in your petition.\u201c\n\nBefore the Commission, Golder submitted two complaints relating respectively to the stopping of his letters (as mentioned above at paragraph 13) and to the refusal of the Home Secretary to permit him to consult a solicitor. On 30 March 1971, the Commission declared the first complaint inadmissible, as all domestic remedies had not been exhausted, but accepted the second for consideration of the merits under Articles 6 para. 1 and 8 (art. 6-1, art. 8) of the Convention.\n\nGolder was released from prison on parole on 12 July 1972.\n\nIn their report, the Commission expressed the opinion:\n\nunanimously, that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) guarantees a right of access to the courts;\n\nunanimously, that in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), whether read alone or together with other Articles of the Convention, there are no inherent limitations on the right of a convicted prisoner to institute proceedings and for this purpose to have unrestricted access to a lawyer; and that consequently the restrictions imposed by the present practice of the United Kingdom authorities are inconsistent with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1);\n\nby seven votes to two, that Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1) is applicable to the facts of the present case;\n\nthat the same facts which constitute a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) constitute also a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) (by eight votes to one, as explained to the Court by the Principal Delegate on 12 October 1974). The Commission furthermore expressed the opinion that the right of access to the courts guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is not qualified by the requirement \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201c. In the application bringing the case before the Court, the Government made objection to this opinion of the Commission but stated in their memorial that they no longer wished to argue the issue.\n\nThe following final submissions were made to the Court at the oral hearing on 12 October 1974 in the afternoon.\n\nfor the Government: \u201cThe United Kingdom Government respectfully submit to the Court that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention does not confer on the applicant a right of access to the courts, but confers only a right in any proceedings he may institute to a hearing that is fair and in accordance with the other requirements of the paragraph. The Government submit that in consequence the refusal of the United Kingdom Government to allow the applicant in this case to consult a lawyer was not a violation of Article 6 (art. 6). In the alternative, if the Court finds that the rights conferred by Article 6 (art. 6) include in general a right of access to courts, then the United Kingdom Government submit that the right of access to the courts is not unlimited in the case of persons under detention, and that accordingly the imposing of a reasonable restraint on recourse to the courts by the applicant was permissible in the interest of prison order and discipline, and that the refusal of the United Kingdom Government to allow the applicant to consult a lawyer was within the degree of restraint permitted, and therefore did not constitute a violation of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. The United Kingdom Government further submit that control over the applicant\u2019s correspondence while he was in prison was a necessary consequence of the deprivation of his liberty, and that the action of the United Kingdom Government was therefore not a violation of Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), and that the action of the United Kingdom Government in any event fell within the exceptions provided by Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2), since the restriction imposed was in accordance with law, and it was within the power of appreciation of the Government to judge that the restriction was necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder or crime. In the light of these submissions, Mr. President, I respectfully ask this honourable Court, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, to hold that the United Kingdom Government have not in this case committed a breach of Article 6 (art. 6) or Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\u201c\n\nfor the Commission: \u201cThe questions to which the Court is requested to reply are the following: (1) Does Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the European Convention on Human Rights secure to persons desiring to institute civil proceedings a right of access to the courts? (2) If Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) secures such a right of access, are there inherent limitations relating to this right, or its exercise, which apply to the facts of the present case? (3) Can a convicted prisoner who wishes to write to his lawyer in order to institute civil proceedings rely on the protection given in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention to respect for correspondence? (4) According to the answers given to the foregoing questions, do the facts of the present case disclose the existence of a violation of Article 6 and of Article 8 (art. 6, art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights?\u201c"}

with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Hikmettin Garbul (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 July 1999.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr A. Terece, a lawyer practising in \u0130zmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 20 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant during police custody and his right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1967 and was serving his sentence in Ayd\u0131n prison at the time of his application to the Court.\n\nA. The detention in police custody and the medical certificates concerning the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant\n\nOn an unspecified date an arrest warrant was issued in respect of the applicant because of his alleged involvement with the PKK, an illegal armed organisation. After receiving an anonymous phone call, police officers arrested the applicant on 2 July 1997 at around 02.00 a.m. The police also searched the house where the applicant stayed. The search and seizure protocol drafted by the police officers and signed by the applicant indicates that he consented to the search.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he was arrested and taken into custody on 30 June 1997 from his house in the Eskiizmir district and that while he was in custody he was subjected to various forms of torture. In particular, he submitted that he was beaten, sworn at, threatened, blindfolded, given electric shocks and hosed with pressurized water. He further claimed that his mother fainted when the police officers started to beat him at his home at the time of his arrest.\n\nAccording to the medical report drawn up on 2 July 1997 at around 11.40 a.m. the applicant complained of blows to his chest. The doctor found that the applicant had a 1 cm graze on the right side of his forehead and a hyperaemic region (redness) in the middle of his chest.\n\nThe applicant was interrogated by the police officers at the Anti-terror branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on 3 July 1997.\n\nAccording to the medical report drafted on 3 July 1997 the applicant complained of blows to his chest. The doctor found that the applicant had a 1 cm graze on the right side of his forehead and a hyperaemic region (redness) in the middle of his chest and a graze of 1 cm on his right leg.\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 3 July 1997 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court. The applicant stated to the prosecutor, inter alia, that Agit (code name) threatened him and told him to collect money for the PKK while he was working as a musician at wedding ceremonies and that he had to give money from his own pocket. He further gave information about some people and denied knowing Mr M.K, Mr F.\u00d6, Mr S.T or Mr F.K. He stated that if he did some things it was because he was forced to do so and that he was a victim. When he was asked about his previous statements given to the police, he claimed that these statements were his true statements.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was brought before the Izmir State Security Court. The applicant reiterated, inter alia, that he was threatened and forced by Agit and some other PKK militants to collect money and to conduct a one minute silence to Kurdistan martyrs during wedding ceremonies. He submitted that he was not a member of the organization. He acknowledged his previous statements given to the public prosecutor and denied his statements given to the police. He claimed that they were not his and that he had just signed them. The court ordered his remand in custody.\n\nThe applicant alleges that during his transfer to prison he was beaten and sworn at by the soldiers.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment accusing the applicant of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. He requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the criminal proceedings against the applicant commenced before the Izmir State Security Court.\n\nOn 19 August 1997 the Izmir State Security Court decided that the case brought against the applicant be joined to the case brought against twenty\u2011five other suspects. In that hearing the applicant's representative submitted that the applicant's statements had been taken under duress and the applicant had only given money to Agit because he mistook him for the organiser of a wedding.\n\nIn a hearing held on 31 March 1998 the applicant stated that he did not accept the statements of some of the co-accused, claiming that they had given these statements under torture.\n\nFollowing the decision of the court to join another case-file to the trial, the public prosecutor, on 12 March 1998, accused the applicant of membership of an illegal organisation and requested that he be convicted and charged under Article 168 \u00a7 2 and Article 5 of Law no. 3713.\n\nOn 21 May 1998 the Izmir State Security Court, referring to the statements of Mr A.P., a photo identification report, statements of Mr S.\u00c7. (\u201cAgit\u201d) and Mr S.T., the gun found buried in the applicant's garden and the findings of the ballistic report in this respect, held that it had been established that the applicant had entered into a permanent hierarchical and organic relationship with the organization. The court, referring to the aforementioned evidence, stated that it did not find the applicant's denials convincing. The applicant was convicted under Article 168 \u00a7 2 and Article 5 of Law no. 3713 and sentenced to twelve years and six months' imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant appealed. In his petition, he submitted, inter alia, that the court had taken into account, in his view, statements given under duress. He also suggested that the statements of those who accused him had been obtained through illegal methods, in violation of Article 135 (a) of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 23 February 1999 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nC. Relevant Procedure before the Court\n\nBy a letter dated 28 July 1999 the applicant lodged an application with the Court. By letters dated 14 November 1999, 17 February 2000, 12 July 2000 and 29 September 2000 the Registry requested the applicant to submit supporting documents in respect of his complaint pertaining to his alleged ill-treatment.\n\nD. Investigation instigated into the applicant's alleged ill-treatment\n\nOn 1 November 2000 the applicant filed a complaint with the \u0130zmir public prosecutor (hereinafter: \u201cthe prosecutor\u201d) against the police officers at the anti-terror branch of the Izmir Security Directorate (hereinafter: \u201cthe police\u201d). The applicant submitted, inter alia, that while he was held in police custody between 30 June and 2 July 1997 he had been subjected to torture. He gave details of the alleged ill-treatment and claimed that when he was brought before the doctor for a medical examination, two police officers were in the room. He further submitted that the police were also next to him while he gave his statements to the public prosecutor and the court on 3 July 1997. Finally, he claimed that he had been beaten and sworn at during his arrest in the presence of his family members and that he was also beaten while he was transferred to remand in custody. He claimed that he did not know their names but would be able to recognise some of them if he saw them.\n\nOn an unspecified date the prosecutor heard the applicant who repeated that he had been ill-treated while he was held in detention.\n\nOn 11 December 2000 the prosecutor decided not to initiate criminal proceedings against the police on account of lack of evidence. In particular, the prosecutor noted that the findings of the medical report issued at the end of the applicant's stay in custody (3 July 1997) mirrored those in the medical report drawn up on the day of his arrest (2 July 1997). In this decision, the prosecutor noted that the applicant was caught while hiding in a house in theYamanlar district.\n\nOn 7 February 2001 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court dismissed the applicant's objections."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 62279/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Hamdi Atiman (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 17 November 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Kiran, a lawyer practising in Van. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 27 September 2011 the complaint concerning Article 2 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n\nFollowing the communication of the application, the Government, but not the applicant, filed further written observations (Rule 54 \u00a7 2). However, the applicant indicated his wish to pursue his application.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Van.\n\nAccording to the incident and the crime scene investigation reports, upon receipt of intelligence that terrorists were hiding in the area, on 24 June 2008 a large group of gendarme officers from the Hakkari Mountain Commando Brigade blocked the road near the village of Armutd\u00fcz\u00fc in the Y\u00fcksekova district. At about 1.30 a.m. the gendarme officers stopped a lorry on suspicion of fuel smuggling. Subsequently, another lorry approached the gendarme officers. The applicant was travelling in this vehicle and it was being driven by his cousin, N.A. The soldiers ordered them to stop, but N.A. continued to drive. According to the report drafted by the gendarme officers, the driver attempted to escape and the gendarme officers fired a warning shot in the air and then fired at the tyres of the lorry to stop it. According to the applicant, they were driving down a steep hill at high speed, and as the brakes had failed, they could not stop. They maintained that they had shouted from the window that the brakes were not working and N.A. had tried to avoid hitting the other lorry, which was parked in the middle of the street, by trying to pass it on the right. He then headed towards the hills, where there was a group of gendarme officers. The gendarme officers opened fire, first in the air and then at the vehicle. The applicant was wounded in the hip and his cousin in the leg during the incident as a result of ricochet bullets.\n\nThe crime scene investigation report revealed that there were no bullet holes on the left side or the back of the lorry. Three of the tyres were flat, namely the two front tyres and the rear right tyre. Eight bullet holes were observed on the right wing over the tyres, three bullet holes in the petrol tank, a bullet entry and exit hole on the front right door, and another bullet hole on the right wheel rim. The gendarme officers further collected a total of nine bullet cases from the scene of the incident.\n\nOn the same day, a major from the District Gendarmerie wrote to the Y\u00fcksekova Public Prosecutor and requested authorisation to search the two vehicles which had been stopped by the gendarmes. Upon receipt of authorisation, the gendarme officers searched the two lorries. They found sixty\u2011six barrels of smuggled fuel in the first lorry and forty-five barrels in the applicant\u2019s cousin\u2019s lorry. No other illegal items were found in the vehicles. The applicant\u2019s cousin, N.A., declined to sign the search report.\n\nAlso on the same day, two gendarme officers tested the lorry belonging to the applicant\u2019s cousin in the presence of the village mayor. They reported that the vehicle had three flat tyres, that there were four bullet holes in the petrol tank, that the engine was working correctly and that the brake system was intact.\n\nSubsequently, on the same day, the applicant\u2019s cousin gave a statement to the Y\u00fcksekova Public Prosecutor and stated that the applicant had been taken to Van Hospital. He requested that criminal proceedings be initiated against the gendarme officers who had used force against them. He emphasised that when he had been told to stop he had been driving down a steep hill at high speed, and when he could not stop, he had shouted from the window that the brakes were not working. He had had no intention of escaping from the gendarmes. He further denied that he had been transporting smuggled fuel and maintained that the barrels found by the gendarmes must have been from the other vehicle.\n\nThe public prosecutor also took statements from two eyewitnesses to the incident. These two individuals had also been in the lorry which had been stopped by the gendarmes on suspicion of fuel smuggling. According to their statements, while they were being questioned by the gendarme officers about the barrels found in their lorry, they saw another vehicle approaching. The gendarmes ordered the driver to stop but the driver failed to obey, shouting from the window that the brakes had failed. The driver then tried to pass their vehicle, which was blocking the road, on the right. The gendarmes opened fire, first into the air and then at the tyres. Both witnesses stated that the driver had no intention of escaping and was shouting that he was unable to stop.\n\nOn 15 December 2008, the applicant\u2019s cousin, N.A., gave a statement to the Hakkari Public Prosecutor. He explained that on the day of the incident, while he was driving down a steep hill, the gendarme officers ordered him to stop. He called out that he would stop, but the gendarmes opened fire and he was shot in the leg. He was able to stop the vehicle by using the handbrake. He stated that he had had no intention or reason to escape.\n\nOn 20 February 2009 a statement was taken from the applicant at Iskele police station. He explained that on the day of the incident he had been travelling in his cousin\u2019s lorry. His cousin had told him that there was a problem with the brake system of the vehicle. When they approached the checkpoint, a gendarme officer ordered them to stop, and they shouted out that there was a problem with the brakes and that they were not able to stop. The gendarme thought that they were trying to escape and fired a shot in the air and then started shooting at them. The applicant was shot in the hip. He concluded that the gendarme who had shot at them was not at fault, as he must have thought that they were trying to escape.\n\nOn 22 July 2008 statements were taken from the accused gendarme officers by a sergeant from the Yenik\u00f6pr\u00fc Gendarme Command. They all stated that they had ordered the driver of the lorry to stop on suspicion of fuel smuggling. The driver initially stopped the vehicle. When the officers asked about the load of the lorry, he started driving away in an attempt to escape. The officers explained that they first fired warning shots in the air and then shot at the tyres to stop the lorry. They considered that the force they had used had been proportionate as they had only used their guns, whereas they were also equipped with heavy machine guns and hand grenades.\n\nBased on the evidence in the file, on 26 April 2009 the Y\u00fcsekova Public Prosecutor delivered a decision not to prosecute. He concluded that the use of force had been legal pursuant to Article 11 of Law no. 2803 on the establishment, duties and jurisdiction of the gendarmerie and section 39 (i) of the Regulation on the Duties and Powers of the Gendarmerie. He found it established that the driver of the vehicle in which the applicant was travelling had disobeyed the order to stop and had continued driving. He further pointed out that the lorry had not stopped and that the officers had first fired warning shots in the air and had then shot at the tyres of the lorry.\n\nOn 4 June 2009 the Van Assize Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding the decision of the Y\u00fcksekova Public Prosecutor to be in line with domestic law."}

of the Swiss Confederation (\u201cthe Government\u201c) on 13 March and 13 April 1987 respectively, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 11368/85) against Switzerland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swiss national, Mr. Edmund Sch\u00f6nenberger, and a Turkish national, Mr. Mehmet Durmaz, on 10 January 1985. The Commission\u2019s request referred to the declaration whereby Switzerland recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46) and to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48); the Government\u2019s application referred to Articles 45, 47 and 48 (art. 45, art. 47, art. 48). Both sought a decision from the Court as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 8 (art. 8). The Commission also sought a decision under Article 10 (art. 10).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings. The President of the Court gave Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger leave to appear on his own behalf, while Mr. Durmaz designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert, the elected judge of Swiss nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 3 (b)). On 23 May 1987, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other five members, namely Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Sir Vincent Evans, Mr. R. Bernhardt, Mr. A. M. Donner and Mr. J. De Meyer (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 4) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr. J. Cremona, substitute judge, replaced Mr. Donner, who was unable to attend (Rules 22 \u00a7 1 and 24 \u00a7 1).\n\nMr. Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted those who would be appearing before the Court on the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 \u00a7 1). In accordance with the order made in consequence on 7 August 1987, the Registrar received the Government\u2019s memorial on 21 September 1987 and the applicants\u2019 memorial on 7 October. On 19 November, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nHaving consulted - through the Registrar - the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the applicants, the President directed on 1 December 1987 that the oral proceedings should commence on 22 February 1988 (Rule 38). On 15 January 1988, he gave Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger and his assistant leave to plead in German (Rule 27 \u00a7 3).\n\nThe hearing was held in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting immediately beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr. O. Jacot-Guillarmod, Head of the Department of International Affairs, Federal Department of Justice, Agent, Mr. R. Levi, former federal judge, Mr. B. M\u00fcnger, Federal Department of Justice, Counsel;\n\nfor the Commission Mr. S. Trechsel, Delegate;\n\nfor Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger Mr. E. Sch\u00f6nenberger, Rechtsanwalt, Applicant; Ms. B. Hug, Rechtsanw\u00e4ltin, Assistant;\n\nfor Mr. Durmaz, applicant Mr. J.-P. Garbade, avocat, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr. Jacot-Guillarmod and Mr. Levi for the Government, Mr. Trechsel for the Commission and Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger, Ms. Hug and Mr. Garbade for the applicants, as well as their replies to its questions. At the hearing, the Commission, the Government and the applicants lodged with the registry various documents, either at the President\u2019s request or on their own initiative.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first applicant, Edmund Sch\u00f6nenberger, who is a Swiss citizen born in 1942, practises as a Rechtsanwalt (lawyer) in Z\u00fcrich. The second applicant, Mehmet Durmaz, who is a Turkish national born in 1950, lives at Onex, in Switzerland. He is a taxi-driver.\n\nA. Stopping of a letter and enclosure from Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger to Mr. Durmaz\n\nOn 16 February 1984, acting on a statement by one O, the district prosecutor (Bezirksanwalt) for Pf\u00e4ffikon (Canton of Z\u00fcrich) issued a warrant for Mr. Durmaz\u2019s arrest, in connection with suspected offences under federal legislation relating to the misuse of drugs. The applicant was arrested on the same day by the Geneva police and taken to Z\u00fcrich the following day, where he was questioned for the first time by officials from the prosecutor\u2019s office. He was further questioned and also confronted with other suspects on 23 and 24 February, and on each occasion he cooperated by answering all the questions put to him.\n\nMr. Durmaz\u2019s wife, who had been informed of the arrest on 16 February, spoke on the telephone to the Pf\u00e4ffikon district prosecutor on 20 and 24 February. On these occasions she asked him whether her husband had a lawyer. He replied that he had not but added that he would take care of it. She also wrote to her husband on 21 and 24 February. In the second letter, which reached him on 28 February, she expressed the hope that the \u201clawyer\u201c - whose name she did not mention - \u201cwould look after [him]\u201c. On 24 February, she asked Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger to take charge of Mr. Durmaz\u2019s defence. The first applicant immediately called the district prosecutor to advise him and to say that he would be sending authorisation forms and a letter. Also, on 24 February, he sent a letter and enclosure to the district prosecutor\u2019s office, as required by the relevant legislation, requesting the district prosecutor to forward them to the addressee. The enclosure comprised a copy of the covering letter to the district prosecutor, two forms giving authority to act and a letter to Mr. Durmaz, which read as follows (translation from the German): \u201cSir, I am instructed by your wife to undertake your defence. You will find enclosed two forms giving me authority to act for you. If you wish to authorise me to represent you, please send one of the forms to the district prosecutor and return the other one to me (duly signed). It is my duty to point out to you that you are entitled to refuse to make any statement. Anything you say may be used in evidence against you. If you choose to remain silent, the district prosecutor will have to prove your guilt by other means (witnesses, etc.). He will usually then try to influence you by arguing that in that case you will remain in custody on remand until such time as he has questioned witnesses, other suspects, etc. If this does not worry you (i.e. a possible prolongation of your detention on remand), it will be to your advantage to exercise your right not to make any statement. Once I have received your authority to act, I shall apply for permission to visit you and will come and see you. At all events, be patient: you will have to be released at some stage! Yours faithfully ...\u201c\n\nThe district prosecutor probably received the letter and enclosure for Mr. Durmaz on Monday 27 February, but kept them from him without telling him that he had received them. On the same day, he asked Mr. Durmaz to choose a lawyer. Mr. Durmaz, being unable to pay for one, applied for the only Z\u00fcrich lawyer he knew, Mr. Garbade, to be assigned officially to him; the presiding judge of the Pf\u00e4ffikon District Court duly appointed Mr. Garbade on 1 March.\n\nIn an order made on 1 March, the prosecutor\u2019s office decided not to communicate to Mr. Durmaz the letter and forms which were intended for him. It did so on the following ground (translation from the German): \u201cAs long as Edmund Sch\u00f6nenberger is not the suspect\u2019s authorised legal representative, the general provisions of the Prisons Ordinance [see paragraph 18 below] apply to him. Section 53(3) prohibits the forwarding of letters concerning the preparation of a case for trial. In the present letter, Edmund Sch\u00f6nenberger has recommended to the suspect a particular course of conduct for the preparation of the case. In virtue of the aforementioned provision, his letter will therefore not be forwarded.\u201c The prosecutor\u2019s office returned to Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger the said documents together with the copy of the covering letter.\n\nOn various dates between 5 and 23 March 1984, Mr. Durmaz was again questioned and confronted with other suspects. He also received visits from Mr. Garbade. On 8 March, Mr. Garbade had asked the presiding judge of the District Court to offer Mr. Durmaz the possibility of choosing between Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger and himself as his defence lawyer. The two lawyers had a conversation on 9 March, as a result of which they agreed that Mr. Garbade would continue to assist Mr. Durmaz and that Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger would challenge the order made on 1 March (see paragraphs 14 to 16 below).\n\nMr. Durmaz was freed on 23 March 1984. On 29 May 1985 the Z\u00fcrich district prosecutor ordered that he had no case to answer as it could not be excluded beyond all possible doubt that someone else had been mistaken for him. In respect of his detention on remand, the prosecutor awarded him 3,000 Swiss francs (CHF) which the Z\u00fcrich District Court increased to 3,565 CHF on 30 October 1985.\n\nB. The appeals against the Pf\u00e4ffikon district prosecutor\u2019s order of 1 March 1984\n\nThe applicants lodged two appeals against the order of 1 March 1984 (see paragraph 11 above); the first of these was rejected by the Department of Justice of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich on 19 March 1984, and the second was dismissed by the presiding judge of the Pf\u00e4ffikon District Court on 11 April 1984.\n\nOn 7 April 1984, they lodged a public-law appeal with the Federal Court against the decision of the Department of Justice; they alleged an infringement of the federal Constitution and of the Convention. During the proceedings they stated that they did not propose to challenge the dismissal of their second appeal.\n\nIn a judgment on 20 June, which was notified on 6 November 1984, the Federal Court allowed the appeal in part. It noted in the first place that Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger could not rely on the privileges conferred on prisoners\u2019 defence lawyers under section 53(3) of the Prisons Ordinance. The Federal Court added that the prosecutor\u2019s office had not infringed either the Constitution or the Convention by intercepting Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger\u2019s letter to Mr. Durmaz, since it related to pending criminal proceedings and gave the addressee advice on the behaviour to adopt during the investigation. On the other hand, the Federal Court held that the decision to withhold the two authorisation forms and the copy of the covering letter to the prosecutor\u2019s office was contrary to the Constitution: since these documents did not relate to pending criminal proceedings, section 53(3) could not be relied on in respect of them. The Federal Court also pointed out that a person who has been charged with a criminal offence is at all times entitled to ask for a lawyer and to receive a form for giving authority to act. It concluded that the disputed measure was a disproportionate restriction on freedom of correspondence and on the rights of the defence. It consequently set aside the Department of Justice\u2019s decision and awarded the applicants costs of 500 CHF.\n\nII. NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND CASE-LAW\n\nAccording to the general principles of criminal procedure, a suspect is under no obligation to make any statements. The Federal Court has held that, under the Constitution, he has the right to remain silent and that he cannot normally be held to have culpably obstructed the proceedings on the sole ground that he has refused to reply to questions, unless there has been some abuse of the right (Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court, vol. 106 (1980), part I a), p. 8, and vol. 109 (1983), part I a), p. 169).\n\nIn the Canton of Z\u00fcrich, the monitoring of correspondence with persons in custody is governed by section 53 of the District Prisons Ordinance of 19 April 1972 (Verordnung des Kantons Z\u00fcrich vom 19. April 1972 \u00fcber die Bezirksgef\u00e4ngnisse), which was made under section 73 of the law of 6 July 1941 by which the Swiss Criminal Code was enacted. Section 53(3) reads as follows (translation from German): \u201cNo correspondence with co-prisoners and former co-prisoners (except for close relatives) shall be allowed. Letters jeopardising the purpose of detention or prison security shall not be forwarded; letters relating to pending criminal proceedings shall be forwarded only if they form part of correspondence with a defence lawyer. A prisoner shall be informed if a letter is not forwarded.\u201c\n\nIn 1973, the Federal Court considered the constitutionality of various provisions of the Z\u00fcrich Ordinance of 1972. As regards the restrictions on freedom of correspondence, it noted the following (translation from German): \u201cSection 53 lays down in particular that letters \u2018whose content is improper\u2019 or which relate to pending criminal proceedings shall not be forwarded. Correspondence with co-prisoners or former co-prisoners is likewise prohibited. On the other hand, communications addressed to supervising authorities or to a defence lawyer are not subject to any restrictions. The applicant alleges that prohibiting communications \u2018whose content is improper\u2019 goes much too far and leaves too great a discretion to the officials responsible for monitoring correspondence. In his submission, the prohibition should apply only to communications whose content is \u2018illicit\u2019. This change of wording would make no appreciable difference, since the second concept is likewise very imprecise in the present context. The applicant does not dispute the need to prohibit the dispatch of letters with a particular type of content, and that is the very purpose of the monitoring. It is clear, therefore, that any correspondence which might assist in the preparation of escape plans or the commission of fresh criminal offences, or which could have an impermissible influence on criminal proceedings (danger of collusion) must be prohibited. Even assuming that it is in principle desirable to maintain contacts with the outside world, these contacts must not compromise the purpose of detention. Moreover, the supervising authorities must also be given the right to hold back any communications which might jeopardise order in the prison. Conversely, the authorities cannot refuse to forward communications which do not jeopardise either the purpose of detention or order in the prison and which are permissible in their quantity (s. 52). It is accordingly of little consequence whether or not the supervising authority approves the content of such communications (cf., on the legal situation in Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 14 March 1972, vol. 33, no. 1). It is not possible to make an accurate general statement of where the line should be drawn, since it depends on the particular circumstances of each case. The general principle laid down in the disputed ordinance accordingly cannot be criticised as being unconstitutional, at least not if regard is had to the fact that correspondence with the supervising authorities and defence lawyers is not subject to any marked degree of control.\u201c (Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court, vol. 99, part I a), pp. 288-289) PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nThe applicants applied to the Commission on 10 January 1985 (application no. 11368/85). They claimed that the Pf\u00e4ffikon district prosecutor\u2019s stopping of the letter from Mr. Sch\u00f6nenberger to Mr. Durmaz had violated their right to respect for their correspondence (Article 8 of the Convention) (art. 8) and their freedom of expression (Article 10) (art. 10).\n\nThe Commission declared the application admissible on 4 March 1986. In its report of 12 December 1986 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) and that no separate issue arose under Article 10 (art. 10). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment. CONCLUDING SUBMISSIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nAt the hearing, the Government confirmed the submissions contained in their written pleadings. In them they invited the Court \u201cto conclude that in the present case the non-forwarding of the letter in issue addressed by the first applicant to the second applicant, who was detained on remand and did not know the sender of the letter, did not constitute a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention or of any other provision of that instrument\u201c."}

originated in an application (no. 39652/98) against the French Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Tunisian national, Mr Nouri Maaouia (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 December 1997.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the length of proceedings he had brought on 12 August 1994 for the rescission of an exclusion order, which proceedings had ended with the judgment of the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal of 26 January 1998, had been unreasonable, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe case was referred to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe case was assigned to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). On 12 January 1999 the Chamber decided to adjourn the examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings for rescission of the exclusion order (Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible [Note by the Registry. The Court\u2019s decision is obtainable from the Registry.].\n\nOn 1 February 2000 the Chamber, composed of the following judges: Sir Nicolas Bratza, President, Mr J.-P. Costa, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr K. Jungwiert, Mr K. Traja and Mr M. Ugrekhelidze, and of Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar, decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties being opposed thereto (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).\n\nThe composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. In a decision of 22 March 2000 [Note by the Registry. The Court\u2019s decision is obtainable from the Registry.] the Grand Chamber declared the remainder of the application admissible, while reserving the issue of the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe applicant and the French Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) each filed written observations on the merits of the case.\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 5 July 2000. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr R. Abraham, Director of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mrs C. d\u2019Urso, Head of the Human Rights Office, Department of European and International Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Mr P. Boussaroque, administrative court judge, on secondment to the Legal Affairs Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Counsel; (b) for the applicant Mr A. Chemama, of the Nice Bar, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr Chemama and Mr Abraham.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1958 in Tunisia, entered France in 1980 at the age of 22. On 14 September 1992 he married a French national, an invalid whose disability had been assessed at 80%, with whom he had been living since 1983.\n\nOn 1 December 1988 the Alpes-Maritimes Assize Court sentenced the applicant to six years\u2019 imprisonment for armed robbery and armed assault with intent for offences committed in 1985. He was released on 14 April 1990.\n\nOn 8 August 1991 the Minister of the Interior made a deportation order against him. The order was served on the applicant, who had been unaware of its existence, on 6 October 1992, when he attended the Nice Centre for Administrative Formalities in order to regularise his status.\n\nHe refused to travel to Tunisia and was prosecuted for failing to comply with a deportation order. On 19 November 1992 the Nice Criminal Court sentenced him to one year\u2019s imprisonment and made an order excluding him from French territory for ten years. That decision was upheld on appeal by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal on 7 June 1993. An appeal on points of law was dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 1 June 1994 on the ground that the applicant had failed to challenge the legality of the deportation order in the courts below.\n\nOn 22 July 1994 the applicant applied to the Criminal Cases Review Board of the Court of Cassation for a review of the criminal proceedings that had resulted in his being imprisoned for one year and banned from French territory for ten years. In a judgment of 28 April 1997, which was served on 22 September 1997, the Court of Cassation dismissed that application.\n\nA. Proceedings before the administrative courts for an order quashing the deportation order made against the applicant\n\nIn December 1992 the applicant sought judicial review of the deportation order. In a judgment of 14 February 1994 the Nice Administrative Court quashed the deportation order of 8 August 1991, inter alia, on the ground that no notice had been served on the applicant requiring him to appear before the Deportation Board. That judgment became final on 14 March 1994 after being served on the Minister of the Interior.\n\nB. Application for rescission of the exclusion order\n\nOn the strength of the administrative court\u2019s judgment of 14 February 1994 quashing the deportation order, the applicant applied to the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal on 12 August 1994 for rescission of the ten-year exclusion order made by the Nice Criminal Court on 19 November 1992. He contended that he was married to a French national and held a provisional residence permit.\n\nIn a letter of 6 July 1995 the applicant reminded the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the terms of his application for rescission. Noting that the application had been outstanding for some time, he asked the office to arrange for it to be heard and a ruling given. On 12 July 1995 the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office requested the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Nice tribunal de grande instance for its opinion on the merits of the application and any information that would assist the court in deciding whether the exclusion order should be rescinded. On 19 September 1995 Nice Central Police Station sent the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office the results of an inquiry concerning the applicant.\n\nOn 3 November 1997 the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the Court of Appeal informed the applicant that the case would be heard on 26 January 1998. On that date the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal granted the applicant\u2019s application and rescinded the exclusion order on the ground that the Nice Administrative Court had quashed the deportation order.\n\nC. Steps taken by the applicant to regularise his immigration status\n\nThe applicant also sought to regularise his status with the immigration authorities. He initially obtained acknowledgment forms for applications for provisional residence permits (not work permits) for renewable three-month periods. On 4 September 1995, however, he was given a new three-month residence permit incorporating the right to seek employment.\n\nOn 14 September 1995 the applicant applied to the prefect for the Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement for a residence permit allowing him to live and work in France for a prolonged period, as he was married to a French citizen. On 9 April 1996 the applicant received notice of a decision dated 2 April 1996 refusing him a residence permit. He appealed to the Nice Administrative Court, but his appeal was dismissed on 27 September 1996.\n\nThe applicant appealed on 24 December 1996 to the Lyons Administrative Court of Appeal. On 29 August 1997 the President of that court ordered the transfer of the file to the Marseilles Administrative Court of Appeal \u2013 the court with jurisdiction \u2013 where the case is currently pending.\n\nOn 21 July 1998 the applicant obtained a temporary residence permit valid for one year (from 13 July 1998 to 12 July 1999). Recently he obtained a ten-year residence permit with the right to seek employment."}

the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Austrian national, Werner Gabriel (\u201cthe applicant\u201d).\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms Baumgartner-Gabriel, a lawyer practising in Graz. The Austrian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant complained, in particular, that there was no public hearing in the disciplinary proceedings against him before the Administrative Court.\n\nOn 1 December 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Graz.\n\nThe applicant was, at the time of the events, a civil servant in a public employment relationship with the Styria Regional Government (Landesregierung). He worked at the Department for Legal Affairs (Traffic Department).\n\nOn 17 May 1993 the Department for Legal Affairs (Human Resources) laid disciplinary information against the applicant.\n\nThe Disciplinary Commission at the Office of the Regional Styria Government (Disziplinarkommission des Amtes der Landesregierung) decided, on 21 June 1993, to institute the main disciplinary proceedings on account of seventeen specific charges dating from December 1990 to April 1993 and suspended the applicant from his duties (Einleitungs- und Suspendierungsbeschluss).\n\nOn 21 September 1994 the Disciplinary Commission decided to hold a hearing (Verhandlungsbeschluss) in the disciplinary matter against the applicant, charging him on twenty-four counts. However, in the summons for the hearing the Disciplinary Commission informed the applicant on 2 October 2005 that only counts 1 to 14 would be subject matter of the hearing.\n\nA hearing was held in presence of the applicant and his counsel on 7 December 1995 following which the Disciplinary Commission held the applicant liable in respect of ten counts of misbehaviour. It imposed a disciplinary penalty of immediate retirement with a deduction of 20% of his pension benefits. On the remaining four counts the Disciplinary Commission found no reason to take further action.\n\nOn 7 November 1996 the Senior Disciplinary Board at the Office of the Styria Regional Government (Disziplinaroberkommission des Amtes der Landesregierung) on the basis of the result of an oral hearing upheld this decision with regard to six counts, but found no reason for criticism as regards the remaining four counts. As a result the disciplinary penalty was reduced by setting the deduction of the applicant's pension benefits at 15%.\n\nThe applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court on 9 January 1997. The applicant also requested the Constitutional Court to hold a public hearing.\n\nThe Constitutional Court declined to deal with the applicant's complaint for lack of prospect of success on 9 June 1998 and, on 24 June 1998, remitted the case to the Administrative Court at the applicant's request.\n\nOn 23 September 1998 the applicant supplemented his complaint as requested by the Administrative Court and requested again a public hearing to be held. In his complaint he argued that the Senior Disciplinary Board had not been properly composed and that there were inconsistencies as to the number of charges in the decision to institute proceedings, the decision to hold a hearing and for which he was eventually held liable. Further, the authorities had not properly gathered the evidence and had erred in its assessment.\n\nOn 15 December 1999 (served on the applicant's counsel on 24 January 2000) the Administrative Court, without a hearing, dismissed the applicant's complaint as unfounded."}

and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Jerzy Lewak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 23 May 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 14 September 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Rejowiec Fabryczny.\n\nA. The alleged ill-treatment of the applicant\n\nIt appears that in November 2002 the Che\u0142m District Prosecutor charged the applicant with armed robbery. On an unspecified date in November 2002 the court ordered his detention on remand. He was detained in the Che\u0142m Prison. In connection with the criminal investigation against the applicant, the District Prosecutor ordered the applicant to provide a sample of his body odour.\n\nAccording to the applicant, on 13 March 2003 he was called to the interrogation room in the Che\u0142m Prison where he was informed that he was to provide the required samples. However, the applicant stated that he would provide them only in the presence of his lawyer. According to the applicant, he was then knocked over and kicked by two police officers and a prison guard. During that time he also lost his gold neck chain. Subsequently, the applicant agreed to provide the samples.\n\nThe applicant claimed that as a result of the beating he had bruises on his abdomen, his back and his waist. He also had pain in his spine.\n\nOn 24 March 2003 the applicant filed a criminal complaint with the Che\u0142m District Prosecutor, alleging that he had been beaten on 13 March 2003 by two police officers and a prison guard. He further alleged that his gold chain had been stolen during the incident.\n\nOn 24 April 2003 the District Prosecutor opened an investigation. She heard the applicant and the two police officers and prison guard involved in the alleged incident. She also heard two other police officers who had been working in a neighbouring room at the time of the alleged incident.\n\nThe District Prosecutor established that the applicant had been told to provide the samples and, if he refused, that they would be taken against his will. After some persuasion, the applicant had agreed to provide the samples. All the officers confirmed that version of events and stated that force had not been used.\n\nThe District Prosecutor obtained other relevant evidence which did not corroborate the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment. Between 13 March and 1 April 2003 the applicant was seen by a prison doctor on five occasions. He did not report any injuries linked to his alleged ill-treatment and no such injuries were detected. On 27 March 2003 an ambulance was called for the applicant since he had complained about pain in his abdomen. On that occasion, the applicant did not mention any injuries related to his alleged ill-treatment and had received pain killers.\n\nAs regards the missing neck chain, the District Prosecutor found that at the time of his admission to the prison the applicant had not declared any valuables. Nor had he reported the loss of his neck chain to the prison administration.\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, on 30 June 2003 the District Prosecutor discontinued the investigation. She held that there was no evidence to support the view that the offences of assault and theft as alleged by the applicant had been committed.\n\nThe applicant appealed against that decision to the Lublin Regional Prosecutor. On an unspecified date the Regional Prosecutor upheld the decision of 30 June 2003 and transmitted the applicant's appeal to the Che\u0142m District Court for review.\n\nOn 20 October 2003 the Che\u0142m District Court upheld the decision of 30 June 2003.\n\nMeanwhile, on 12 September 2003 the Che\u0142m District Prosecutor had discontinued the investigation against the applicant concerning the charge of armed robbery. She held that the evidence obtained in the course of the investigation, including the samples of his body odour, did not confirm that the applicant had taken part in the armed robbery.\n\nB. The alleged censorship of the applicant's correspondence with the Court\n\nThe envelope in which the applicant sent his first letter from the Che\u0142m Prison to the Court dated 21 May 2003 bears the following stamps: \u201ccensored\u201d (ocenzurowano) and \u201cthe Che\u0142m District Court\u201d (S\u0105d Rejonowy w Che\u0142mie). It also bears a stamp confirming that the applicant's letter was received for dispatch by the prison administration on 23 May 2003. However, according to the postal stamp the letter was posted only on 3 June 2003. It also appears that the envelope had been cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape.\n\nThe envelope in which the applicant sent his application form from the Che\u0142m Prison to the Court dated 27 October 2003 bears the following stamps: \u201ccensored\u201d (ocenzurowano) and \u201cthe Che\u0142m District Court\u201d (S\u0105d Rejonowy w Che\u0142mie). It also bears a stamp confirming that the applicant's letter was received for dispatch by the prison administration on 3 November 2003. However, according to the postal stamp the letter was posted only on 13 November 2003. It also appears that the envelope had been cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 7436/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by three Turkish nationals, Mr \u0130smail \u015eencan, Ms H\u00fclya \u015eencan and Mr Nejdet \u015eencan (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 12 October 2001.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr F. Yurdakul, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 1 June 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1955, 1973 and 1962 respectively and live in Istanbul.\n\nThe applicants signed contracts with third persons before the notary public to acquire de facto possession (zilyedlik) of a plot of land in G\u00f6k\u00e7eada.\n\nOn 10 May 1990, 27 August 1991 and 18 May 1992 respectively, the applicants filed three separate actions with the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction and requested that their title to the plot in question be registered in the Land Registry records.\n\nOn 11 September 1991 and 16 March 1992 respectively the first\u2011instance court partially accepted the requests of the first and third applicants. Subsequently, on 28 April 1992 and 6 November 1992 respectively, the Court of Cassation quashed these judgments, holding that the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction had failed to carry out the necessary examination in order to determine the nature of the plot. The cases were remitted to the first-instance court.\n\nOn 12 October 1992 and 15 March 1993 the first-instance court once again partially accepted \u0130smail and Nejdet \u015eencan's claims. On 21 June 1993 the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction also partially accepted the second applicant's claim. In its judgments, the first-instance court held that the fact that the land in question appeared as \u201cmeadowland\u201d in the tax registration records did not mean that it could not be the subject of private ownership.\n\nOn 18 April 1994 the Court of Cassation quashed the three judgments of the first-instance court and held that the first-instance court should have taken into account the tax registration records and accepted the applicants' claims only in respect of the parts of the plot which were used for agriculture. It further held that meadowlands could not be subject to private ownership. The cases were remitted to the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction.\n\nOn 26 September 1994 all three cases were joined.\n\nOn 13 June 1995 the first-instance court again partially accepted the applicants' claims. In its judgment, the court stated that the plot in question was not designated as \u201cmeadowland\u201d in the land registration records and that, therefore, it could be subject to private ownership.\n\nOn 24 June 1996 the Court of Cassation once again quashed the judgment of the first-instance court, holding that according to the documents in the case-file, the plot in question was meadowland and that therefore the applicants could not have their title registered.\n\nOn 31 July 1996 the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Civil Court of General Jurisdiction issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and sent the case file to the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Cadastre Court.\n\nOn 5 June 1997 the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Cadastre Court rendered its judgment and partially accepted the applicants' claims.\n\nOn 20 May 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the cadastre court.\n\nOn 16 April 1999 the G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Cadastre Court abided by the Court of Cassation's decision, holding that according to the tax registration records the land in question was meadowland and that it could not be subject to private ownership. The court further held that the land should be officially designated as a second degree conservation area.\n\nOn 21 March 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nOn 6 April 2001 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants' request for rectification. This decision was served on the applicants' representative on 30 April 2001."}

with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Mr Daniel Nowak and Mr Bogus\u0142aw Zaj\u0105czkowski (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 28 August 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 26 August 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1927 and 1938 respectively and live in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland.\n\n1. The facts prior to 1 May 1993\n\nOn 22 June 1992 the applicants sued the \u201cWroc\u0142awskie Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Rob\u00f3t In\u017cynieryjnych Budownictwa Przemys\u0142owego nr 2\u201d (\u201cthe defendant company\u201d) before the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court, seeking remuneration for the defendant company\u2019s use of an industrial invention of which they were the authors.\n\nThe Regional Court held 3 hearings on the following dates: 21 December 1992; 1 February and 2 April 1993.\n\n2. The facts after 1 May 1993\n\nThe Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court held 11 hearings on the following dates: 3 November and 22 December 1993; 29 January 1994; 20 February, 27 July and 23 November 1995; 30 January, 27 February, 10 July and 11 September 1997, and 21 December 1998.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings the Regional Court obtained five expert reports. It appears that two other experts (K.N. and R.B.) returned the case file after 5 months without having prepared a report as ordered by the court.\n\nThe applicant repeatedly complained to the President of the Regional Court and the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal about delays in the proceedings. On 6 February 1998 the President of the Regional Court and on 27 October 1998 the President of the Court of Appeal acknowledged that there had been delays.\n\nOn 30 June 1998 the applicants and the defendant company concluded an out-of-court settlement in respect of a minor part of the applicants\u2019 claims.\n\nOn 21 December 1998 the Regional Court gave judgment. It dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims and discontinued the proceedings in respect of the claims which had been the subject of the settlement. The applicants appealed against that judgment.\n\nOn 9 April 1999 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal held a hearing. On the same day it quashed the judgment of the Regional Court and remitted the case.\n\nThe Regional Court held 6 hearings on the following dates: 22 September, 13 October and 9 November 1999; 7 and 22 April and 1 December 2000. It obtained 3 additional expert reports.\n\nOn 15 December 2000 the Regional Court gave judgment. It allowed the applicants\u2019 claims in part. The defendant company appealed against that judgment. However, on 25 June 2001 it withdrew its appeal. Consequently, on 27 June 2001 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal discontinued the appeal proceedings.\n\nOn 12 July 2001 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal issued an enforcement order in favour of the applicants in respect of the judgment of the Regional Court of 15 December 2000.\n\nOn 22 November 2001 the defendant was declared insolvent.\n\nProceedings for compensation for damage suffered due to the excessive length of proceedings\n\nOn 10 November 2004 the applicants sued the State Treasury before the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court, seeking compensation for the excessive length of the proceedings referred to above.\n\nOn 10 February 2005 the first applicant (Mr Daniel Nowak) withdrew his claim. Consequently, on 28 February 2005 the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings in respect of the first applicant.\n\nOn 29 September 2005 the Regional Court gave judgment and dismissed the second applicant\u2019s claim. It found that he had failed to establish the State Treasury\u2019s liability for damage caused by the excessive length of the proceedings. The second applicant (Mr Bogus\u0142aw Zaj\u0105czkowski) appealed. The appeal proceedings are pending."}

under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by twelve Turkish nationals, Mr Ahmet G\u00fcven, Mr Ramazan Akda\u011f, Mr Kadri S\u00f6nmez, Mr Metin G\u00f6ktepe, Ms Neslihan G\u00f6ktepe, Mr \u0130zzettin Ko\u00e7, Mr Kadri Iss\u0131, Mr Mehmet K\u0131\u015fanak, Mr R\u0131dvan Karatay, Mr Ali Kemal Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Mr Ya\u015far Avc\u0131 and Ms Emsihan Karatay (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 30 October 2000.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr T. F\u0131rat, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 23 September 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1968, 1972, 1964, 1966, 1973, 1962, 1976, 1962, 1963, 1971, 1970 and 1969 respectively. They were detained in the Buca prison, in \u0130zmir, at the time of the events giving rise to the present application.\n\nA. Events in Buca Prison\n\nOn 20 July 1995 the applicants, along with ten other prisoners, were taken from their cells to an area of the prison in order to be brought before the \u0130zmir State Security Court for trial. According to the applicants, while they were waiting to be collected, they were attacked by prison administrators, prison warders and gendarmes using truncheons and wooden planks, because they had objected to being searched. According to the Government the applicants had resisted the search, attached themselves to one another and subsequently fallen down the stairs and injured themselves. The applicants were then taken to the \u0130zmir State Security Court in prison vehicles.\n\nAt the hearing before the State Security Court, the applicants' complained that they had been beaten before being brought before the court. The court noted the applicants' condition and decided to postpone the proceedings on the ground that it was impossible to hold a hearing in such circumstances. It ordered that the applicants be medically examined and that the results be sent to the \u0130zmir public prosecutor's office with a view to the opening of an investigation. A letter to that effect was sent the same day to the public prosecutor.\n\nB. The investigation concerning the incident in Buca prison\n\nA preliminary investigation was instigated by the \u0130zmir public prosecutor's office into the allegations of the applicants. On 20 July and 14 August 1995 the prosecutor took statements from the applicants who reiterated that they were beaten by the gendarmes and the prison wardens.\n\nOn 20 July 1995 a forensic expert examined Ahmet G\u00fcven, Kadri S\u00f6nmez, Metin G\u00f6ktepe, Neslihan G\u00f6ktepe, \u0130zzettin Ko\u00e7, Kadir Iss\u0131, Mehmet K\u0131\u015fanak, R\u0131dvan Karatay, Ali Kemal Y\u0131ld\u0131z and Ms Emsihan Karatay in prison.\n\nIn his report, the doctor noted that Emsihan Karatay complained of a pain in her head and her left leg. The doctor decided that the applicant be referred to the orthopaedist at the Izmir State Hospital.\n\nAs regards Neslihan G\u00f6ktepe, he observed that there were swellings on her head, behind her left ear and an erythema on her back as a result of blows. He also noted a graze on her neck. The doctor concluded that Neslihan G\u00f6ktepe should be re-examined by a forensic expert at the Izmir Forensic Medicine Institute in seven days.\n\nIn respect of Kadri Iss\u0131, the doctor noted erythemas on the upper left part of his back and on his left arm. He further observed a wound and haemorrhage under his left ear. Kadri Iss\u0131 further complained of pain in the lower right part of his back. The doctor considered that the injuries rendered the applicant unfit for work for fifteen days.\n\nAs to \u0130zzettin Ko\u00e7, the medical report referred to wounds over his eyebrows and nose and several ecchymoses, erythemas and grazes on his back and his left knee which had been caused by blows. The doctor concluded that the injuries rendered \u0130zzettin Ko\u00e7 unfit for work for ten days and that he would recover within twenty days following a medical treatment.\n\nAs regards Mehmet K\u0131\u015fanak, the doctor observed swellings and erythemas on the upper part of the back, underneath the chin and around the nose and mouth as a result of blows. He further noted an erythema on the applicant's right leg. The doctor concluded that the injuries rendered Mehmet K\u0131\u015fanak unfit for work for ten days and that he would recover within twenty days following a medical treatment.\n\nAs regards R\u0131dvan Karatay, the medical report referred to an erythema and a swelling on the right eye orbit, erythemas and ecchymoses on the upper part of the back as a result of blows. The applicant further complained of pain in his head. The doctor decided that R\u0131dvan Karatay should be referred to the ophthalmologist at the Izmir State Hospital.\n\nWith regard to Kadri S\u00f6nmez, the forensic expert noted erythemas and swellings on the upper part of his back, on both his arms and his right ear. The applicant also complained of pain in his left leg. The doctor observed that the injuries rendered the applicant unfit for work for five days.\n\nAs to Ali Kemal Y\u0131ld\u0131z, the report referred to swellings and erythemas on the applicant's back, neck, and head and to an ecchymosis behind his ear as a result of blows. There were also erythemas on the applicant's left arm and left leg. The doctor further noted that the applicant complained of pain in his head and his chin. He concluded that the injuries rendered him unfit for work for seven days and considered that he would recover within five days.\n\nAs regards Metin G\u00f6ktepe, the doctor observed swellings, erythemas and ecchymoses behind the applicant's head, on his chin, back, neck and arms as a result of blows. The forensic expert concluded that the injuries rendered him unfit for work for ten days and considered that he would recover within twenty days following medical treatment.\n\nFinally, as regards Ahmet G\u00fcven, the medical report referred to pain in the applicant's head, wounds on the right eye orbit and around the eyebrows, to swellings and pain in his right arm and to ecchymoses and grazes on his back and around his ribs. The doctor decided that the applicant be referred to the orthopaedist at the Izmir State Hospital.\n\nOn 18 August 1995 an expert from the Forensic Medicine Institute examined Ramazan Akda\u011f and sent the medical report to the Izmir public prosecutor's office. According to this report this applicant sustained the following injuries: haemorrhage on the right sclera, swelling of 4 x 4 cm on the post-parietal bone on the scalp, erythemas on the forehead, swellings and ecchymoses on the zygomas, the orbits and the left ear, swelling and a scar on the lower lip, a trauma on the left clavicle, ecchymosis of 10 cm in diameter on the left hemithorax and ecchymotic lesions on the right hemithorax. The forensic expert considered that the injuries were not life threatening but rendered him unfit for work for seven days and that he would recover within twenty days.\n\nOn 17 November 1995 a doctor from the Forensic Medicine Institute reported that Ya\u015far Avc\u0131, who was hospitalised on 20 July 1995 with the diagnosis of \u201cgeneral body trauma\u201d, had sustained the following injuries at the time of the hospitalisation: ecchymoses on the back and on both shoulders, a graze of 2 x 2 cm on the right zygoma, erythemas in the forehead, sensitivity on the left tibia. The doctor considered that the applicant should wear a cervical collar. According to the report of 17 November 1995 the applicant was discharged from the hospital on 28 July 1995 and was re\u2011examined on 9 October 1995. The expert concluded that the injuries had not been life threatening but had rendered him unfit for work for ten days and that he would recover.\n\nOn 9 April 1996 the prosecutor decided not to prosecute the Director of Buca Prison and his staff for alleged ill-treatment of the applicants. The applicants objected to this decision. On 25 June 1996 the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Assize Court dismissed the applicants' objection.\n\nOn 11 April 1996 the prosecutor transferred the investigation file concerning the gendarmes to the \u0130zmir Administrative Council. However, the case file subsequently went astray after it was sent to the Divisional Gendarme Command at Buca Prison.\n\nOn 1 May 2000 \u0130zmir Administrative Council decided to open an investigation against three gendarme officials in connection with the disappearance of the above-mentioned case file. It however decided not to bring proceedings against the gendarmes responsible for the transfer of the applicants to court on 20 July 1995.\n\nThe Government informed the Court that the proceedings against the gendarmes who had lost the file were terminated by a decision of non\u2011prosecution on 15 January 2002 on account of the expiry of the statutory time-limit.\n\nThe applicants claimed that they were never informed of the outcome of the proceedings and that they learned of the decision of the \u0130zmir Administrative Council when the Court delivered its judgment in the case of Sat\u0131k and Others (no. 31866/96, 10 October 2000) which had been lodged by ten other prisoners who had been injured on 20 July 1995 in Buca prison.\n\nC. The detention conditions of Ahmet G\u00fcven\n\nThe applicant was convicted of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of a part of the national territory under Article 125 of the Criminal Code and sentenced to death on 2 December 1998. This judgment became final on 17 April 2000 after the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. On 6 September 2002 the applicant's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the \u0130zmir Assize Court.\n\nIt appears from the case-file that the applicant took part in hunger strikes on various occasions and that as a result his health deteriorated.\n\nAccording to the medical report issued by Bitlis State Hospital on 26 June 2003 the applicant suffered from hypertension, anxiety and slight amnesia. On 15 July 2003 the Bitlis State Hospital Medical Commission issued an additional report in which it concluded that the medical condition of the applicant did not necessitate the suspension of his sentence.\n\nOn 28 July 2003 the applicant requested the suspension of his sentence pursuant to Article 399 of the Criminal Code on Procedure. On 17 July 2003 the Bitlis public prosecutor, relying on the aforementioned reports of the Bitlis State Hospital, dismissed the applicant's request. No document has been submitted by the parties as to whether the applicant objected to this decision.\n\nAccording to a medical report issued by Bitlis State Hospital on 24 June 2004 the applicant suffered from hypertension, depression, vertigo (light-headedness) and head pains. The applicant was prescribed medication as well as a special diet. Following this report the prison authorities decided that the applicant be given a special diet.\n\nAccording to a medical report issued by two doctors, Mr U.O. and Mr N.S., on 1 November 2005, the applicant was diagnosed in 2003 as suffering from hypertension and amnesia. They noted that he was receiving drug treatment and that he could physically continue to take care of himself within a prison facility.\n\nThe Government submitted a number of documents as regards the applicant's transfer to various medical centres for check-up and the results of his analyses."}

against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by eleven Turkish nationals, Mr \u015eeyho Saya, Mr Hasan \u00d6lg\u00fcn, Mr \u00c7etin Ta\u015f, Mr M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Atasoy, Ms Z\u00f6hre Ta\u015f, Mr Ak\u0131n Do\u011fan, Mr Nedim \u00c7if\u00e7i, Ms Hediye Kilin\u00e7, Mr Ali Murat Bilgi\u00e7, Mr Bahattin Bar\u0131\u015f Bilgi\u00e7 and Ms Zeynep Saya (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 20 November 2001.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr \u015eeyho Saya, the first applicant, who is a lawyer practising in Ad\u0131yaman. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 September 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1964, 1969, 1964, 1971, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1975, 1964, 1971 and 1965 respectively, and live in Ad\u0131yaman.\n\nOn 30 April 1999 the Ad\u0131yaman Governor authorised the holding of May Day celebrations in the Ad\u0131yaman Amphitheatre, located in the Hasanc\u0131k District.\n\nOn 1 May 1999 a group of people, including the applicants, gathered in the building of the Health Workers\u2019 Trade Union and started to walk towards the amphitheatre for the May Day celebrations. They were stopped by police officers. Stating that they had obtained prior authorisation from the Governor, the group attempted to continue its march. The police then intervened to disperse the group; the applicants were allegedly injured during this incident as a result of the force used by the police. According to the incident report, thirty-eight people, including the applicants, were arrested. The applicants were subsequently taken to the Ad\u0131yaman State Hospital, where they were examined by a doctor. The medical reports in respect of Ms Zeynep Saya, Mr Hasan \u00d6lg\u00fcn, Mr M\u00fcsl\u00fcm Atasoy, Ms Z\u00f6hre Ta\u015f, Mr Nedim \u00c7if\u00e7i and Ms Hediye Kilin\u00e7 stated that there were no signs of ill-treatment on their bodies. As regards the remaining applicants, the following findings were indicated in the respective medical reports: \u2013 \u015eeyho Saya: Tenderness on the back of the right leg and on the back. \u2013 \u00c7etin Ta\u015f: Tenderness on the lower left side of the chest and pain while breathing. Tenderness and pain on the right side of the forehead. Possible fracture of the ribs on the left side of the chest. \u2013 Ak\u0131n Do\u011fan: Scratches on the back. \u2013 Ali Murat Bilgi\u00e7: Tenderness and bruises on the left shoulder and the left arm. \u2013 Bahattin Bar\u0131\u015f Bilgi\u00e7: Scratches on the right elbow, the right knee and hyperaemia on the left side of the chest.\n\nThe applicants were then taken into custody. They were released the next day.\n\nOn different dates in May 1999 the applicants filed criminal complaints with the Ad\u0131yaman Public Prosecutor against those police officers who had allegedly used excessive force during their arrest.\n\nOn 17 June 1999 the Ad\u0131yaman Public Prosecutor transferred the case file to the Ad\u0131yaman Provincial Administrative Council, seeking authorisation to bring criminal proceedings against the accused officers, pursuant to the provisions of Law on the prosecution of Civil Servants.\n\nOn 16 February 2000 the Ad\u0131yaman Provincial Administrative Council found that there was not enough evidence to initiate criminal proceedings against the accused officers and consequently refused to do so. On 1 September 2000 the applicants appealed against this decision. In their appeal petition, they invoked a breach of Article 11 of the Convention, arguing that the police interference had breached their freedom of assembly. On 14 June 2001 the Supreme Administrative Council upheld the decision of the Administrative Council.\n\nIn the meantime, on 1 June 1999 the Ad\u0131yaman Public Prosecutor, after examining a video recording of the incident, delivered a decision not to prosecute with regard to seventy demonstrators \u2013 including the applicants \u2013 who had been involved in the incident on 1 May 1999. In reaching his decision, the Public Prosecutor stated that the demonstrators had been stopped by the police, although they had been walking silently along the pavement, without presenting a danger to the public or engaging in any violent activities. It was also indicated in the decision that, pursuant to section 24 of the Assemblies and Marches Act (Law no. 2911), the police were under an obligation to warn the group out loud to disperse; however, it was observed from the recording of the incident that they had failed to do so. In consequence, the public prosecutor held that the accused had not violated Law no. 2911."}
