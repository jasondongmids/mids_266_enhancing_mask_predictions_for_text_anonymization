Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by four Turkish nationals, Mr Galip Yalman, Mr Bahattin Sar\u0131soy, Mr Osman \u00c7a\u011flayan and Mr Yusuf \u00c7amca (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 29 November 1996.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr S. Esmer, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicants alleged that their case, which commenced in 1989 and terminated in 1996, was not heard within a reasonable time as required by the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nBy a decision of 15 May 2003, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nIn September 1980 the applicants were taken into police custody and were subsequently placed in detention on remand on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. The Erzincan Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Erzincan Martial Law Court (s\u0131k\u0131y\u00f6netim askeri mahkemesi) charging the applicants under Article 146 of the Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation whose object was to undermine the constitutional order.\n\nOn various dates between 1982 and 1984 the applicants were released pending trial.\n\nOn 13 September 1988 the Erzincan Martial Law Court acquitted the applicants of the charges against them.\n\nOn various dates in March, April and June 1989 the applicants brought individual actions before the Sinop Assize Court against the Treasury, pursuant to Law no. 466. They requested compensation for their unjustified detention on remand.\n\nOn 20 October 1989 the court decided to join the applicants\u2019 cases.\n\nOn 15 December 1993 the Sinop Assize Court awarded non\u2011pecuniary compensation to the applicants. The applicants appealed, arguing that the amount of compensation awarded was not sufficient.\n\nOn 31 January 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court.\n\nOn 6 June 1995 the Sinop Assize Court increased the amount of non\u2011pecuniary compensation.\n\nOn 15 June 1995 the applicants again appealed.\n\nOn 30 May 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the judgment of the assize court."}

Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Turkish nationals, Mr Mehmet B\u00fclent Y\u0131lmaz and Mr \u015eahin Y\u0131lmaz (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 20 May 1998.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr H.\u00c7. Akbulut, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 21 March 2002 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1975 and 1970 respectively.\n\nOn 19 and 20 August 1995 respectively the applicants were taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Ayd\u0131n Security Directorate on suspicion of their membership to an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP/C.\n\nIn their police statements the applicants accepted the accusations against them.\n\nOn 22 August 1995 the applicants were brought before the investigating judge at the Ayd\u0131n Magistrate\u2019s Court, where they repeated the statements they had made to the police. The investigating judge ordered that they be placed in detention on remand.\n\nIn an indictment dated 6 September 1995, the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants. He charged the first applicant with being member of an armed gang under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and the second applicant with aiding and abetting an armed gang under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.\n\nDuring the hearings before the Izmir State Security Court, the applicants denied the statements they had made to the police and the investigating judge.\n\nOn 25 March 1997 the Izmir State Security Court, composed of two civilian judges and a military judge, convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced the first applicant to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment and the second applicant to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. Neither the applicants nor their lawyers were present in this last hearing.\n\nThe applicants appealed. On 12 November 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal, upholding the Izmir State Security Court\u2019s reasoning and assessment of evidence. The decision, which was pronounced in the absence of the applicants and their lawyers, was deposited with the Registry of the Izmir State Security Court on 21 November 1997."}

case originated in an application (no. 19582/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ali \u00c7imen (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 8 December 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. \u0130\u015feri, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 March 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicant during his police custody and the non-communication of the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Izmir.\n\nOn 17 April 2000 the applicant was taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of his involvement in the activities of an illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was interrogated at the Anti-Terrorist branch in the absence of a lawyer. According to a form explaining arrested persons\u2019 rights which the applicant had signed, he had been reminded of the charges against him and of his right to remain silent. In his statement, the applicant admitted to his involvement in the illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn 20 April 2000 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge at the Izmir State Security Court. Before the public prosecutor and the judge, again in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant admitted that he had participated in certain activities of the illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested to visit him; however this request was rejected by the Public Prosecutor.\n\nOn 2 May 2000 the Public Prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with that court, accusing the applicant of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. He requested that the applicant be sentenced and convicted under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).\n\nOn 5 December 2000 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment. In its decision, the court attached particular importance to the applicant\u2019s statements to the investigating judge.\n\nOn 25 December 2000 the applicant appealed. On an unspecified date, the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion. This opinion was not served on the applicant or his representative. On 11 June 2001, the Court of Cassation, upholding the reasoning and assessment of the Izmir State Security Court, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal."}

case originated in an application (no. 21377/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ahmet Kenan Er (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 April 2004. The applicant was represented by Mr H.\u0130. Er, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 18 November 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 10 October 1990 the applicant, who served as a first lieutenant in the Turkish Armed Forces at the material time, was arrested on suspicion of, inter alia, professional misconduct and bribery.\n\nOn 28 March 1991 the military prosecutor at the 33rd Infantry Division Commander's office filed an indictment charging the applicant with twenty-four different offences, including professional misconduct, bribery and assault and battery of his inferiors.\n\nOn 12 May 1993 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty of the remaining offences.\n\nOn 19 January 1994 the Military Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in relation to certain offences and quashed the remainder of the judgment on grounds of, inter alia, insufficient investigation.\n\nOn 7 November 1995 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty as charged for the remaining offences.\n\nOn 6 March 1996 the Military Court of Cassation partially upheld the first-instance court's judgment.\n\nOn 16 April 1996 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court once again acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty of the remaining offences.\n\nOn 9 May 1997 the applicant was expelled from the armed forces.\n\nOn 10 June 1998 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on procedural grounds in relation to certain charges and for being time-barred (zamana\u015f\u0131m\u0131) in relation to the remainder.\n\nOn 5 August 1999 the \u00c7orlu Military Court found the applicant guilty as charged in relation to those offences which were not time-barred and of which he had not already been acquitted.\n\nOn 28 March 2001 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court once again in the light of a recent amendment to the relevant jurisdictional rules, and held that the case should be heard by ordinary criminal courts.\n\nOn 26 December 2001 the \u00c7orlu Military Court issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction and referred the case to the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court.\n\nOn 2 December 2003 the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against the applicant as the prosecution had become time-barred."}

"PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 45288/99) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Jan Ci\u0105gadlak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 May 1998.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nOn 4 December 2001 the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nOn 2 April 1992 the applicant filed with the Warsaw Regional Court (s\u0105d wojew\u00f3dzki) a petition in which he requested the annulment of a judgment delivered in 1947 in criminal proceedings against him, submitting that they had been of a political nature. He also claimed compensation.\n\nOn 10 February 1993 the court annulled that judgment. However, its decision did not relate to the compensation claim.\n\nOn 19 February 1993 the applicant filed another compensation claim.\n\nSubsequently, he lodged several complaints concerning the inactivity of the court, but to no avail.\n\nIn her letters of 15 December 1993 and 29 June 1994, in reply to the applicant's complaints, a judge of the Regional Court informed the applicant that the delay in the examination of his compensation claim was caused by a large number of similar requests lodged with that court and the dearth of judges.\n\nOn 22 February 1995 the court held a hearing. A public prosecutor requested that the proceedings be stayed, submitting that a part of the Regional Court's decision of 10 February 1993 was invalid and required supplementation. Subsequently, the court stayed the proceedings.\n\nThe hearing scheduled for 22 March 1995 was adjourned at the applicant's request.\n\nOn 4 April 1995 the Regional Court asked the Office for the State Protection (Urz\u0105d Ochrony Pa\u0144stwa) to submit certain documents. The documents were submitted to the court on 27 March 1996.\n\nOn 4 July 1996 the proceedings were resumed.\n\nThe court adjourned the hearing scheduled for 23 January 1997, as the proceedings concerning the annulment of the criminal judgment against the applicant given in 1947 had not been completed.\n\nOn 19 June 2000 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment. It awarded the applicant PLN 7,500 in compensation. He did not lodge an appeal against that judgment."}
